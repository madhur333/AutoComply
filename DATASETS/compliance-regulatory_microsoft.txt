Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Benchmarks
Article • 03/21/2025

About CIS Benchmarks
The Center for Internet Security  is a nonprofit entity whose mission is to 'identify, develop,
validate, promote, and sustain best practice solutions for cyberdefense.' It draws on the
expertise of cybersecurity and IT professionals from government, business, and academia from
around the world. To develop standards and best practices, including CIS benchmarks, controls,
and hardened images, they follow a consensus decision-making model.

CIS benchmarks  are configuration baselines and best practices for securely configuring a
system. Each of the guidance recommendations references one or more CIS controls  that
were developed to help organizations improve their cyberdefense capabilities. CIS controls
map to many established standards and regulatory frameworks, including the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53, the ISO 27000 series of standards, PCI
DSS, HIPAA, and others.

Each benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first occurs during initial
development when experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts until they reach
consensus on the benchmark. During the second phase, after the benchmark has been
published, the consensus team reviews the feedback from the internet community for
incorporation into the benchmark.

CIS benchmarks provide two levels of security settings:

Level 1 recommends essential basic security requirements that can be configured on any
system and should cause little or no interruption of service or reduced functionality.
Level 2 recommends security settings for environments requiring greater security that
could result in some reduced functionality.

CIS Hardened Images  are securely configured virtual machine images based on CIS
Benchmarks hardened to either a Level 1 or Level 2 CIS benchmark profile. Hardening is a
process that helps protect against unauthorized access, denial of service, and other
cyberthreats by limiting potential weaknesses that make systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Microsoft and the CIS Benchmarks
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) has published benchmarks for Microsoft products and
services including the Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmarks, the



Windows 11 Benchmark, and the Windows Server 2022 Benchmark. The CIS Microsoft Azure
Foundations Benchmark  is intended for customers who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or
secure solutions that incorporate Azure. The document provides prescriptive guidance for
establishing a secure baseline configuration for Azure.

CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems
and data against cyberattacks. Used by thousands of businesses, they offer prescriptive
guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration. System and application
administrators, security specialists, and others who develop solutions using Microsoft products
and services can use these best practices to assess and improve the security of their
applications.

Like all CIS benchmarks, the Microsoft benchmarks were created using a consensus review
process based on input from subject matter experts with diverse backgrounds spanning
software development, audit and compliance, security research, operations, government, and
law. Microsoft was an integral partner in these CIS efforts. For example, Microsoft 365 was
tested against the listed services, and the resulting Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark
covers a broad range of recommendations for setting appropriate security policies that cover
account and authentication, data management, application permissions, storage, and other
security policy areas.

In addition to the benchmarks for Microsoft products and services, CIS has published CIS
Hardened Images on Azure  configured to meet CIS Benchmarks and available from
Microsoft Azure Marketplace. These images include the CIS Hardened Images for Windows
Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022, as well as many versions of Linux. All CIS Hardened
Images that are available in Azure Marketplace are certified to run on Microsoft Azure. As
stated by CIS , 'they've been pre-tested for readiness and compatibility with the Microsoft
Azure public cloud, Microsoft Cloud Platform hosted by service providers through the Cloud
OS Network, and on-premises private cloud Windows Server Hyper-V deployments managed
by customers'.

CIS Hardened Images  are securely configured virtual machine images based on CIS
Benchmarks hardened to either a Level 1 or Level 2 CIS Benchmark profile. Hardening is a
process that helps protect against unauthorized access, denial of service, and other cyber
threats by limiting potential weaknesses that make systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. CIS
Hardened Images are available on both Azure and Azure Government.

For additional customer assistance, Microsoft provides Azure Blueprints , which is a service
that helps you deploy and update cloud environments in a repeatable manner using
composable artifacts such as Azure Resource Manager templates to provision resources, role-
based access controls, and policies. Resources provisioned through Azure Blueprints adhere to
an organization's standards, patterns, and compliance requirements. The overarching goal of



Azure Blueprints is to help automate compliance and cybersecurity risk management in cloud
environments. To help you deploy a core set of policies for any Azure-based architecture that
must implement CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark recommendations, Microsoft has published
the Azure Blueprint for CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark. When assigned to an
architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for compliance with assigned policy
definitions.

Frequently asked questions
Will following CIS Benchmark settings ensure the security of my applications?



CIS benchmarks establish the basic level of security for anyone adopting in-scope Microsoft
products and services. However, they shouldn't be considered as an exhaustive list of all
possible security configurations and architecture but as a starting point. Each organization
must still evaluate its specific situation, workloads, and compliance requirements and tailor its
environment accordingly.

How often are CIS Benchmarks updated?

The release of revised CIS Benchmarks changes depending on the community of IT
professionals who developed it and on the release schedule of the technology the benchmark
supports. CIS distributes monthly reports that announce new benchmarks and updates to
existing benchmarks. To receive these, register for the CIS Workbench  (it's free) and check
Receive newsletter in your profile.

Who contributed to the development of Microsoft CIS Benchmarks?

CIS notes that its 'Benchmarks are developed through the generous volunteer efforts of subject
matter experts, technology vendors, public and private CIS Benchmark community members,
and the CIS Benchmark Development team.' For example, you'll find a list of Azure contributors
on CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v1.0.0 Now Available .

Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR
Attestation
Article • 04/05/2023

CSA STAR Attestation overview
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)  is a nonprofit organization led by a broad coalition
of industry practitioners, corporations, and other important stakeholders. It's dedicated
to defining best practices to help ensure a more secure cloud computing environment,
and to helping potential cloud customers make informed decisions when transitioning
their IT operations to the cloud. In 2013, the CSA and the British Standards Institution
launched the Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk (STAR)  registry, a free, publicly
accessible registry in which cloud service providers (CSPs) can publish their CSA-related
assessments.

For security assessments, CSPs use the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)  to evaluate and
document their security controls. CCM is a controls framework composed of 197 control
objectives covering fundamental security principles across 17 domains to help cloud
customers assess the overall security risk of a CSP.

STAR provides two levels of assurance :

Level 1: Self-Assessment based on the Consensus Assessments Initiative
Questionnaire (CAIQ) . Level 1 is an introductory offering, which is free and open
to all CSPs. The CAIQ contains more than 250 questions based on the CCM that a
customer or cloud auditor may want to ask of CSPs to assess their compliance with
CSA best practices.
Level 2: Independent third-party assessments such as CSA STAR Attestation and
CSA STAR Certification. These assessments combine established industry standards
with criteria specified in the CCM.

７ Note

CSA has released CCM v4 , a major update to the CCM that has 197 control
objectives structured in 17 domains. CCM and CAIQ have been combined in version
4. CSA has also provided a CCM v4 transition timeline  for cloud service
providers and other organizations to start using version 4.



CSA STAR Attestation involves a rigorous independent third-party audit of a cloud
provider's security posture based on a SOC 2 Type 2 audit with CCM criteria. The
independent auditor that evaluates a cloud provider's offerings for STAR Attestation
must be a certified public accountant (CPA) and is required to have the CSA Certificate in
Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK).

The Azure SOC 2 Type 2 audit is based on the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Principles and Criteria, including security, availability,
confidentiality, and processing integrity, and the criteria in CCM v4. STAR Attestation
provides an auditor's findings on the design suitability and operating effectiveness of
Azure SOC 2 controls. The objective is to meet both the AICPA criteria mentioned
previously and requirements set forth in the CCM.

Applicability

CSA STAR Certification involves a rigorous independent third-party assessment of a
cloud provider’s security posture. It's based on achieving ISO 27001 certification and
meeting criteria specified in the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). CSA STAR Certification
demonstrates that a cloud service provider conforms to the applicable requirements of
ISO 27001, has addressed issues critical to cloud security as outlined in the CCM, and
has been assessed against the STAR Capability Maturity Model for the management of
activities in CCM control areas.

During the assessment, an accredited CSA certification auditor assigns a Management
Capability score to each of the CCM security domains. Each domain is scored on a
specific maturity and measured against five management principles. The internal report
shows organizations how mature their processes are and what areas they need to
consider improving to reach an optimum maturity level.

Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR self-
assessment
Article • 05/09/2025

CSA STAR self-assessment overview
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is a nonprofit organization led by a broad coalition of
industry practitioners, corporations, and other important stakeholders. It is dedicated to
defining best practices to help ensure a more secure cloud computing environment, and to
helping potential cloud customers make informed decisions when transitioning their IT
operations to the cloud.

In 2010, the CSA published a suite of tools to assess cloud IT operations: the CSA Governance,
Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) Stack. It was designed to help cloud customers
assess how cloud service providers (CSPs) follow industry best practices and standards and
comply with regulations.

In 2013, the CSA and the British Standards Institution launched the Security, Trust & Assurance
Registry (STAR), a free, publicly accessible registry in which CSPs can publish their CSA-related
assessments.

CSA STAR is based on two key components of the CSA GRC Stack:

Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM): a controls framework covering fundamental security
principles across 16 domains to help cloud customers assess the overall security risk of a
CSP.
The Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ): a set of more than 140
questions based on the CCM that a customer or cloud auditor may want to ask of CSPs to
assess their compliance with CSA best practices.

STAR provides three levels of assurance; CSA-STAR Self-Assessment is the introductory offering
at Level 1, which is free and open to all CSPs. Going further up the assurance stack, Level 2 of
the STAR program involves third-party assessment-based certifications, and Level 3 involves
certifications based on continuous monitoring.

Microsoft and CSA STAR self-assessment
As part of the STAR Self-Assessment, CSPs can submit two different types of documents to
indicate their compliance with CSA best practices: a completed CAIQ, or a report documenting
compliance with CCM. For the CSA STAR Self-Assessment, Microsoft publishes both a CAIQ and



a CCM-based report for Microsoft Azure, and CCM-based reports for Microsoft Dynamics 365
and Microsoft Office 365.

CyberGRX
Article • 05/09/2025

The CyberGRX assessment methodology identifies both inherent and residual risk and uses
near real time threat analysis and independent evidence validation to provide customers with a
holistic view of their third-party cyber risk posture.

CyberGRX is the world's first and largest collaborative risk exchange. CyberGRX's analytical
methodology builds threat intelligence and sophisticated risk models from just one validated
assessment. With insights on risk across data security and privacy, the CyberGRX assessment
features not only in-depth insights on residual risk, but combines attack scenario modeling and
the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain  to monitor evolving tactics and techniques in the threat
landscape.

Microsoft and CyberGRX
CyberGRX, utilizing their strategic partners Deloitte and Touche and KPMG, has validated and
reported on the assessment of the Microsoft Cloud, which consists of over 1,000 security
questions and corresponding Microsoft responses. CyberGRX addresses inherent risk, industry-
specific threat intelligence, and real-world attack scenarios. This gives customers an ability to
validate Microsoft's security posture with outside-in evidence in order to generate results that
are focused on risk, as opposed to simple compliance.

Microsoft understands the need our customers have to use efficient vehicles that will help their
organization swiftly assess risk, to include assessing potential risks that they may assume due
to using a third-party for key services, like us. As one of the largest cloud service providers in
the world, Microsoft understands that our customer base is vast and diverse and that these
customers have varying priorities and come from various industries. Scaling to these diverse
needs requires Microsoft to look for effective methods to broaden and amplify our ability to
share key knowledge that will help all customers with their their security priorities and
regardless of which Microsoft Cloud services they use. Collaborating with a third-party
assessment firms like CyberGRX is one way we help our customers to be nimbler in their risk
assessment pursuit.

CyberGRX's model gives organizations interested in the Microsoft Cloud's security control
implementation the ability to select the controls they're most interested in and provides
validated responses for their review. Microsoft benefits from this model as we can also be
nimble in our ability to provide updates, and our responses are available to any member of the
CyberGRX exchange, providing more customer access to this key information. In short,
CyberGRX helps Microsoft reach more customers with risk assessment needs and underscores
our commitment to transparency and security.



In addition, customers can use CyberGRX's Framework Mapper feature to map our assessment
controls and responses to well-known industry standards and frameworks, such as NIST 800-
53, NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, all of which can
significantly reduce your due diligence burden.

ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018
Article • 04/05/2023

ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 overview
ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018  is an international standard for IT service management that
defines requirements for the development, implementation, monitoring, maintenance,
and improvement of an IT service management system. A related standard ISO/IEC
20000-2:2019  provides guidance on the application of service management systems.
Moreover, ISO/IEC 27013:2015  guidance on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC
27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 was released for organizations planning to implement
ISO/IEC 20000-1 when ISO/IEC 27001 is already implemented or planning to implement
these two standards together. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 is the only standard in the ISO/IEC
20000 family that results in a formal certification.

The ISO/IEC 20000-1 certificate demonstrates that a cloud service provider has
implemented the right IT service management procedures to deliver efficient and
reliable IT services that are subject to regular monitoring, review, and improvement. It
helps organizations provide assurance to customers that their service requirements will
be fulfilled.

ISO 22301:2012 Business Continuity
Management Standard
Article • 12/07/2023

ISO 22301 overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent
nongovernmental organization and the world's largest developer of voluntary
international standards. The ISO formed the TC 223 Societal Security technical
committee to develop standards for protecting society, including organizations, if
catastrophes such as a natural disaster, major terrorist attack, or the shutdown of power
grids occur.

Published in 2012 by the technical committee, ISO 22301:2012 is the first international
standard for management systems that help ensure business continuity. ISO 22301 is
the premium standard for business continuity, and certification demonstrates
conformance to rigorous practices to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from
disruptive incidents.

Microsoft and ISO 22301
Microsoft is the first hyperscale cloud service provider to receive the ISO 22301
certification for business continuity management. An independent certification body
awarded this certification to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Azure Government, Microsoft
Office 365 (including Commercial, Government, and Education offerings), Microsoft
Defender for Cloud Apps, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Power BI after a stringent
audit covering all aspects of their business continuity processes. The audit covered the
in-scope services listed below and Azure management features, the Azure Portal, and
the systems used to monitor, operate, and update the in-scope services.

ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security
Management Standards
Article • 12/07/2023

ISO/IEC 27001 overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent
nongovernmental organization and the world's largest developer of voluntary
international standards. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is the
world's leading organization for the preparation and publication of international
standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies.

Published under the joint ISO/IEC subcommittee, the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards
outlines hundreds of controls and control mechanisms to help organizations of all types
and sizes keep information assets secure. These global standards provide a framework
for policies and procedures that include all legal, physical, and technical controls
involved in an organization's information risk management processes.

ISO/IEC 27001 is a security standard that formally specifies an Information Security
Management System (ISMS) that is intended to bring information security under explicit
management control. As a formal specification, it mandates requirements that define
how to implement, monitor, maintain, and continually improve the ISMS. It also
prescribes a set of best practices that include documentation requirements, divisions of
responsibility, availability, access control, security, auditing, and corrective and
preventive measures. Certification to ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations comply with
numerous regulatory and legal requirements that relate to the security of information.

Microsoft and ISO/IEC 27001
The international acceptance and applicability of ISO/IEC 27001 is the key reason why
certification to this standard is at the forefront of Microsoft's approach to implementing
and managing information security. Microsoft's achievement of ISO/IEC 27001
certification points up its commitment to making good on customer promises from a
business, security compliance standpoint. Currently, both Azure Public and Azure
Germany are audited once a year for ISO/IEC 27001 compliance by a third-party
accredited certification body, providing independent validation that security controls are
in place and operating effectively.

ISO/IEC 27017:2015 Code of Practice for
Information Security Controls
Article • 12/07/2023

ISO-IEC 27017 Overview
The ISO/IEC 27017:2015 code of practice is designed for organizations to use as a
reference for selecting cloud services information security controls when implementing
a cloud computing information security management system based on ISO/IEC
27002:2013. It can also be used by cloud service providers as a guidance document for
implementing commonly accepted protection controls.

This international standard provides additional cloud-specific implementation guidance
based on ISO/IEC 27002, and provides additional controls to address cloud-specific
information security threats and risks referring to clauses 5-18 in ISO/IEC 27002: 2013
for controls, implementation guidance, and other information. Specifically, this standard
provides guidance on 37 controls in ISO/IEC 27002, and it also features seven new
controls that are not duplicated in ISO/IEC 27002. These new controls address the
following important areas:

Shared roles and responsibilities within a cloud computing environment
Removal and return of cloud service customer assets upon contract termination
Protection and separation of a customer's virtual environment from the
environments of other customers
Virtual machine hardening requirements to meet business needs
Procedures for administrative operations of a cloud computing environment
Enabling customers to monitor relevant activities within a cloud computing
environment
Alignment of security management for virtual and physical networks

Microsoft and ISO/IEC 27017
ISO/IEC 27017 is unique in providing guidance for both cloud service providers and
cloud service customers. It also provides cloud service customers with practical
information on what they should expect from cloud service providers. Customers can
benefit directly from ISO/IEC 27017 by ensuring they understand the shared
responsibilities in the cloud.

ISO/IEC 27018 Code of Practice for
Protecting Personal Data in the Cloud
Article • 12/07/2023

ISO/IEC 27018 overview
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent
nongovernmental organization and the world's largest developer of voluntary
international standards. The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards helps organizations of
every type and size keep information assets secure.

In 2014, the ISO adopted ISO/IEC 27018:2014, an addendum to ISO/IEC 27001, the first
international code of practice for cloud privacy. Based on EU data-protection laws, it
gives specific guidance to cloud service providers (CSPs) acting as processors of
personally identifiable information (PII) on assessing risks and implementing state-of-
the-art controls for protecting PII.

Microsoft and ISO/IEC 27018
At least once a year, Microsoft Azure and Azure Germany are audited for compliance
with ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018 by an accredited third-party certification body.
This audit provides independent validation that applicable security controls are in place
and operating effectively. As part of this compliance verification process, the auditors
validate in their statement of applicability that Microsoft in-scope cloud services and
commercial technical support services have incorporated ISO/IEC 27018 controls for the
protection of PII in Azure. To remain compliant, Microsoft cloud services must be subject
to annual third-party reviews.

By following the standards of ISO/IEC 27001 and the code of practice embodied in
ISO/IEC 27018, Microsoft demonstrates that its privacy policies and procedures are
robust and in line with its high standards.

Customers of Microsoft cloud services know where their data is stored. Because
ISO/IEC 27018 requires certified CSPs to inform customers of the countries/regions
in which their data may be stored, Microsoft cloud service customers have the
visibility they need to comply with any applicable information security rules.
Customer data won't be used for marketing or advertising without explicit
consent. Some CSPs use customer data for their own commercial ends, including
for targeted advertising. Because Microsoft has adopted ISO/IEC 27018 for its in-



scope enterprise cloud services, customers can rest assured that their data will
never be used for such purposes without explicit consent, and that consent can't
be a condition for use of the cloud service.
Microsoft customers know what's happening with their PII. ISO/IEC 27018
requires a policy that allows for the return, transfer, and secure disposal of
personal information within a reasonable period of time. If Microsoft works with
other companies that need access to your customer data, Microsoft proactively
discloses the identities of those sub-processors.
Microsoft complies only with legally binding requests for disclosure of customer
data. If Microsoft must comply with such a request (as in the case of a criminal
investigation), it will always notify the customer unless it's prohibited by law from
doing so.

Office 365: ISO 27001, 27018, and 27017 Audit Assessment Report

Frequently asked questions
To whom does ISO/IEC 27018 apply?

This code of practice applies to CSPs that process PII under contract for other
organizations. At Microsoft, it also applies to the support of these CSPs.

What is the difference between 'personal information controllers' and 'personal
information processors'?

In the context of ISO/IEC 27018:

'Controllers' control the collection, holding, processing, or use of personal
information; they include those parties who control it on another company's
behalf.
'Processors' process information on behalf of controllers; they don't make
decisions as to how to use the information or the purposes of the processing. In
providing its enterprise cloud services, Microsoft (as a vendor to you) is an
information processor.

Where can I view Office 365 compliance information for ISO/IEC 27018?

You can review the ISO/IEC 27018 certificates from BSI (the independent auditor
that validated Microsoft compliance with ISO/IEC 27018) for Office 365 .

Can I use Microsoft's compliance in my organization's certification process?

Yes. If compliance with ISO/IEC 27018 is important for your business and
implementations deployed on any of Microsoft in-scope enterprise cloud services, you
can use Microsoft's attestation of compliance with ISO/IEC 27018 with Microsoft's
certification for ISO/IEC 27001 in your compliance assessment.

However, you're responsible for engaging an assessor to evaluate your implementation
for compliance, and for the controls and processes within your own organization.

ISO/IEC 27701:2019: Privacy Information
Management
Article • 12/07/2023

ISO/IEC 27701:2019 overview
ISO/IEC 27701:2019  is built to complement the widely used ISO/IEC 27001 and
ISO/IEC 27002 standards for information security management. It specifies requirements
and provides guidance for a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS), making
the implementation of PIMS a helpful compliance addition for the many organizations
that rely on ISO/IEC 27001, as well as creating a strong integration point for aligning
security and privacy controls. ISO/IEC 27701 accomplishes this integration through a
framework for managing personal data that can be used by both data controllers and
data processors, a key distinction for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
compliance.

In addition, any ISO/IEC 27701 audit requires the organization to declare applicable
laws/regulations in its criteria for the audit meaning that the standard can be mapped to
many of the requirements under GDPR, or other laws. Once mapped, the ISO/IEC 27701
operational controls are implemented by privacy professionals. An internal or external
third party, who is accredited to assess, then evaluates the organization's compliance
with the requirements of the standard and issues a certificate to that effect. This
universal framework allows organizations to efficiently implement compliance with new
regulatory requirements. Microsoft sponsors the open-sourced Data Protection
Mapping Project  to bring a common understanding of the relationship between
ISO/IEC 27701 and various data protection regulations.

Microsoft Office 365 ISO Full Assessment Report

Frequently asked questions
How does ISO/IEC 27701 help with evolving regulatory requirements?

ISO/IEC 27701 includes an annex containing the operational controls of the standard
that are mapped against relevant requirements in GDPR for controllers and processors.
This mapping is just an example of how privacy regulations can be implemented relative
to the ISO framework. As additional mappings with other regulations become available
and are validated, the operational controls from the standard can be transferred directly
from regulatory review to implementation. This universal framework allows
organizations to reliably implement the relevant regulatory requirements.

How does ISO/IEC 27701 help with audit costs?

As more privacy regulations come into force in various jurisdictions, the pressure to
provide evidence of compliance will also increase. But the costs of disparate regulatory
certifications become prohibitive if every regulation calls for its own unique audit. By
outlining a set of universal operational controls, ISO/IEC 27701 also outlines a universal
compliance framework to audit against, and potentially certify, for multiple regulatory
requirements.

It's important to recognize that the establishment of an official GDPR certification
requires approval by the European regulators. While the alignment between ISO/IEC



27701 and GDPR is evident, an ISO/IEC 27701 certification shouldn't be taken as
evidence of GDPR compliance or official GDPR certification until regulatory decisions are
finalized.

How does ISO/IEC 27701 help with commercial agreements involving PII?

Commercial agreements involving movement of personal information may warrant
certification of compliance. Modern organizations engage in complex data transfers with
a deep network of business partners including partner organizations or co-controllers,
processors such as cloud providers, and sub-processors such as vendors who support
those same processors. Failure to comply with regulations in any part of this network
may lead to cascading compliance issues across the supply chain. This is where a
verification of compliance can be valuable beyond the assurance provided by
contractual terms between these organizations. Since the global economy dictates that
most of these organizations are spread across the world, it's practical to use an
international standard from ISO to manage compliance across the network.

This reliance on compliance increases the importance of certification to the standard.
While not all companies and organizations need to earn such certification, most will
benefit from partners and vendors who do, especially when sensitive or high volumes of
data processing are involved.

How does ISO/IEC 27701 relate to ISO/IEC 27001?

ISO/IEC 27701 is built on top of ISO/IEC 27001, one of the most widely adopted
international standards for information security management. If your organization is
already familiar with ISO/IEC 27001, it's logical and more efficient to integrate the new
privacy controls provided by ISO/IEC 27701. This approach means the implementation
and audit of both will be less expensive and easier to achieve. Key points of ISO/IEC
27701 and ISO/IEC 27001:

ISO/IEC 27001 is one of the most used ISO standards in the world, with many
companies already certified to it.
ISO/IEC 27701 includes new controller- and processor-specific controls that help
bridge the gap between privacy and security. It provides a point of integration
between what may be two separate functions in organizations.
Privacy depends on security. Likewise, ISO/IEC 27701 depends on ISO/IEC 27001
for security management. Certification for ISO/IEC 27701 must be obtained as an
extension of an ISO/IEC 27001 certification and can't be obtained independently.

What should your organization do with ISO/IEC 27701?

No matter the size of your organization and whether it's a controller or a processor,
your organization should consider pursuing certification, either for your own



organization, or requesting it from vendors or suppliers based on your business
requirements. This situation applies especially for processors, sub-processors, and co-
controllers that are processing sensitive or high volumes of personal data. Your
organization should assess its business needs to determine if certification for its own
products and services is suitable.

Microsoft 365 audit reports
The Microsoft 365 SOC 1 Type 2 Reports for Central and Microservices are
available for customers to download via the Service Trust Portal .
Bridge letters and additional audit reports are also available in the Service Trust
Portal.

You must have an existing subscription or free trial account in Microsoft 365 or
Microsoft 365 U.S. Government to download SOC 1 and SOC 2 attestation reports and
any bridge letters as needed.

Frequently asked questions
How often are Microsoft 365 SOC reports issued?

Microsoft commissions a full SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 examination of Office 365
annually. The auditor's reports on these examinations (also known as audits) are issued
as soon as they are ready after that audit. The SOC 3 report, which is based on the SOC
2 examination, is issued at the same time.

Because Microsoft doesn't control the investigative scope of the examination nor the
timeframe of the auditor's completion, there's no set timeframe when these reports are
issued. The reports are usually issued a few months after the end of the period under
examination. Microsoft doesn't allow any gaps in the consecutive periods of
examination from one examination to the next.

Microsoft also commissions a mid-year SOC 1 Type 1 and SOC 2 Type 1 examination of
Microsoft 365 for new Microsoft services that have been issued since the last SOC Type
2 audit. Type 1 audits don't look back over a period of performance.

Due to the sophisticated nature of Office 365, the service scope is large if examined as a
whole. This can lead to examination completion delays due to scale. Microsoft organizes
all the examinations described previously into two categories: Core Services and
Microservices. Microsoft issues a report scoped to each examination.



SOC Type 2 audits examine a rolling 12-month run window (also known as the audit
period or more formally period of performance) with examinations conducted annually
for the period 1-October through 30-September of the next calendar year. The
examination starts promptly after the period of performance is complete.

Microsoft also issues bridge letters (also known as gap letters). These are self-
attestations by Microsoft, not reports based on examinations by the auditor. Bridge
letters are issued during the current period of performance that isn't yet complete and
ready for audit examination. Microsoft issues bridge letters at the end of each quarter to
attest our performance during the prior three-month period. Due to the period of
performance for the SOC type 2 audits, the bridge letters are typically issued in
December, March, June, and September of the current operating period.

How can customers benefit from Microsoft 365 SOC 1 Type 2 attestation?

Customers can use the Microsoft 365 SOC 1 Type 2 attestation when pursuing their own
financial industry-specific compliance requirements such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX),
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
(GLBA), and others.

Where can I get the Microsoft 365 SOC audit documentation including Microsoft's
bridge letters?

For links to audit documentation, see the audit report section of the Service Trust
Portal . You must have an existing subscription or free trial account in Microsoft 365 or
Microsoft 365 U.S. Government to sign in. You can then download audit certificates,
assessment reports, and other applicable documents to help you with your own
regulatory requirements.

Where can I see management responses to exceptions noted?

Most examinations have some observations on one or more of the specific controls
examined. Some number of observations is to be expected. Management responses to
any exceptions are located towards the end of the SOC attestation report. Search the
document for 'Management Response.'

Where can I see user entity responsibilities?

User entity responsibilities are your control responsibilities necessary if the system as a
whole is to meet the SOC 2 control standards. These are located at the very end of the
SOC attestation report. Search the document for 'User Entity Responsibilities.'

System and Organization Controls (SOC)
2 Type 2
Article • 03/14/2025

SOC 2 Type 2 overview
System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Service Organizations are internal control
reports created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
They're intended to examine services provided by a service organization so that end
users can assess and address the risk associated with an outsourced service.

A SOC 2 Type 2 attestation is performed under:

SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes
AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C
section 205, Examination Engagements (AICPA, Professional Standards).
SOC 2 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant
to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy (AICPA
Guide).
TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing
Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, 2017 Trust Services Criteria).

In addition, the Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 attestation report addresses the requirements
set forth in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), and the
Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5:2020) created by the German
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).

Office 365 SOC 2 attestations are based on rigorous comprehensive third-party
examinations (also known as audits) conducted by an independent AICPA accredited
CPA firm. At the conclusion of a SOC 2 audit, the auditor renders an opinion in a SOC 2
Type 2 report, which describes the cloud service provider's (CSP) system and assesses
the fairness of the CSP's description of its controls. It also evaluates whether the CSP's
controls are designed appropriately, were in operation on a specified date, and were
operating effectively over a specified time period. Office 365 SOC 2 Type 2 reports are
relevant to system Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.

System and Organization Controls (SOC) 3
Article • 05/28/2025

SOC 3 overview
System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Service Organizations are internal control reports
created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). They're intended to
examine services provided by a service organization so that end users can assess and address
the risk associated with an outsourced service.

SOC 3 for Service Organizations: Trust Services Criteria for General Use Report is a short, public
facing summary of the SOC 2 Type 2 attestation report for users who need assurances about
service organization's controls, but don't need a full SOC 2 report or aren't eligible under SOC
2 to receive one. Because SOC 3 reports are general use reports, they can be freely distributed.

A SOC 3 report contains a written assertion by service organization management regarding
control effectiveness to achieve commitments based on the applicable trust services criteria,
and service auditor's opinion on whether management's assertion is stated fairly.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
05/30/2025

About WCAG
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making web
content more accessible for people with disabilities. WCAG version 2.0 was published in 2008
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization dedicated to creating
web standards, and updated to WCAG 2.1 in June 2018. In 2012, the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) also published WCAG 2.0 as ISO/IEC 40500:2012.

Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. For policies requiring
conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance.

Microsoft is a major software and cloud-services provider to consumers, businesses, and
governments around the world. To assist customers in making purchasing decisions, Microsoft
publishes Accessibility Conformance Reports describing the extent to which our products and
services support the WCAG criteria. This information can help Microsoft customers determine
whether a particular product or service meets their specific needs.

Microsoft and WCAG
Microsoft's consideration of the WCAG standard in the development of products and services
points to its commitment to making technology and data accessible for all customers.

Microsoft publishes WCAG reports that reflect the complete product or service. It generally
doesn't create reports for individual features or components. Sometimes, Microsoft releases
new components for existing products, or new versions of existing components, which users
can choose to install separately. Microsoft might also publish a WCAG report for these
components.

Criminal Justice Information Services
(CJIS) Security Policy
Article • 09/27/2024

CJIS overview
The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) gives state, local, and federal law enforcement and criminal justice
agencies access to criminal justice information (CJI). CJI includes, for example, fingerprint
records and criminal histories. Law enforcement and other government agencies in the
United States must ensure that their use of cloud services for the transmission, storage,
or processing of CJI complies with the CJIS Security Policy , which establishes minimum
security requirements and controls to safeguard CJI.

The CJIS Security Policy integrates presidential and FBI directives, federal laws, and the
criminal justice community's Advisory Policy Board decisions, along with guidance from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Policy is periodically
updated to reflect evolving security requirements.

The CJIS Security Policy defines 13 areas that private contractors such as cloud service
providers must evaluate to determine if their use of cloud services can be consistent
with CJIS requirements. These areas correspond closely to NIST 800-53, which is also the
basis for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), a
program under which Microsoft has been certified for its Government Cloud offerings.

In addition, all private contractors who process CJI must sign the CJIS Security
Addendum, a uniform agreement approved by the US Attorney General that helps
ensure the security and confidentiality of CJI required by the Security Policy. It also
commits the contractor to maintaining a security program consistent with federal and
state laws, regulations, and standards, and limits the use of CJI to the purposes for which
a government agency provided it.

Microsoft and CJIS Security Policy
Microsoft signs the CJIS Security Addendum in states with CJIS Information Agreements.
These tell state law enforcement authorities responsible for compliance with CJIS
Security Policy how Microsoft's cloud security controls help protect the full lifecycle of
data and ensure appropriate background screening of operating personnel with access



to CJI. Microsoft continues to work with state governments to enter into CJIS
Information Agreements.

Microsoft has assessed the operational policies and procedures of Microsoft Azure
Government, Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 U.S.
Government, and will attest to their ability in the applicable services agreements to meet
FBI requirements for the use of in-scope services.

Office 365 environments
Microsoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated
experience of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide.
Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their customer
data is located. Microsoft may replicate customer data to other regions within the same
geographic area (for example, the United States) for data resiliency, but Microsoft will
not replicate customer data outside the chosen geographic area.

This section covers the following Office 365 environments:

Client software (Client): commercial client software running on customer devices.
Office 365 (Commercial): the commercial public Office 365 cloud service available
globally.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC): the Office 365 GCC cloud
service is available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments,
and contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.

Committee on National Security
Systems Instruction No. 1253 (CNSSI
1253)
Article • 05/06/2023

CNSSI 1253 overview
The Committee on National Security Systems Instruction No. 1253  (CNSSI 1253),
Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systems, provides all
federal government departments, agencies, bureaus, and offices with a guidance for
security categorization of National Security Systems (NSS) that collect, generate,
process, store, display, transmit, or receive National Security Information. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-59  Guideline for Identifying an
Information System as a National Security System provides NSS definitions.

CNSSI 1253 builds on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-
53 , which provides the control baseline for Azure Government FedRAMP High
authorization. However, there are some key differences between CNSSI 1253 and NIST
SP 800-53, including the approach adopted by CNSSI 1253 to define explicitly the
associations of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability to security controls, and to
refine the use of security control overlays for the national security community.

NSS are categorized using separate Low, Medium, and High categorization for each of
the security objectives (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). This approach results
in categorizations such as “Moderate-Moderate-Low”, “Moderate-Moderate-High”, and
so on. CNSSI 1253 then provides the appropriate security baselines for each of the
possible system categorizations using controls from NIST SP 800-53.

Azure and CNSSI 1253
To help you with your own CNSSI 1253 High-High-High baseline requirements, Azure
Government has been validated by a FedRAMP-accredited independent third-party
assessment organization (3PAO). The resulting Security Assessment Plan documents the
testing conducted to validate Azure Government against a selection of CNSSI 1253
security controls for systems requiring High Confidentiality, High Integrity, and High
Availability.

Azure Government maintains:



FedRAMP High provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO) issued by the
FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB)
Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide
(SRG) Impact Level 5 (IL5) provisional authorization (PA) issued by the Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA)

Using these authorizations, the 3PAO performed an analysis of the security controls that
have already been tested to determine which additional CNSSI 1253 security controls
needed to be assessed to ensure compliance with the CNSSI 1253 High-High-High
baseline. The 3PAO examined evidence and conducted interviews to validate the
successful implementation of additional applicable security controls, and published the
results of its complete testing in the CNSSI 1253 Security Assessment Report (SAR).

Applicability
Azure Government

Services in scope
Azure services in scope CNSSI 1253 reflect the Azure Government FedRAMP High
P-ATO scope. For more information, see Cloud services in audit scope.

Attestation documents
For instructions on how to access attestation documents, see Audit documentation. The
following attestation letter is available from the Service Trust Portal (STP) United States
Government  section:

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement (DFARS)
Article • 01/31/2024

DFARS overview
On October 21, 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued its Final Rule amending
the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and imposing
safeguarding and cyber incident reporting obligations on defense contractors whose
information systems process, store, or transmit covered defense information (CDI).

The final DFARS clause 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and
Cyber Incident Reporting) specifies safeguards to include cyber incident reporting
requirements and additional considerations for cloud service providers. Per DFARS
252.204-7012, all DoD contractors and the defense industrial base are required to
comply with DFARS requirements for adequate security 'as soon as practical, but not
later than December 31, 2017.'

Microsoft and DFARS
Microsoft Government Cloud services help the United States defense industrial base and
defense contractor customers meet the DFARS requirements as enumerated in the
DFARS clauses of 252.204-7012 that apply to cloud service providers. When defense
contractors are required to comply with DFARS clause 252.204-7012 in contracts,
Microsoft can support the requirements applicable to cloud service providers for Azure
Government and Office 365 U.S. Government Defense services. Both services
demonstrate support for the capabilities necessary for customers to comply with the
DFARS 7012 clauses through their L5 accreditation to the Department of Defense
Security Requirements Guide.

Frequently asked questions
Which DFARS requirements are supported by Office 365 U.S. Government Defense?

Office 365 U.S. Government Defense allows our defense industrial base and defense
contractor customers to meet the DFARS requirements as enumerated in the DFARS
clauses of 252.204-7012 that apply to cloud service providers.



Has an independent assessor validated that Office 365 U.S. Government Defense
supports DFARS requirements?

Yes, a third-party assessment organization has attested that the Office 365 U.S.
Government Defense cloud service offering meets the applicable requirements of DFARS
Clause 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding Unclassified Controlled Technical Information).

What is the relationship between Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and
covered defense information (CDI)?

CUI is information that requires safeguarding or disseminating controls according to
law, regulation, or government-wide policy. The CUI Registry  identifies approved CUI
categories and subcategories.

CDI is controlled technical information or other information (as described in the CUI
Registry) that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls and is either:

Marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order, and
provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in connection with the
performance of the contract or
Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the
contractor in support of the performance of the contract

Do all Microsoft Office 365 services meet the 'adequate security' requirements
applicable to 'covered defense information' under the DFARS regulation?

In October 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) promulgated a final rule
implementing Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clauses that
apply to all DoD contractors who process, store, or transmit 'covered defense
information' through their information systems. The rule states that such systems must
meet the security requirements set forth in NIST SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled
Unclassified Information in nonfederal information systems and organizations , or an
'alternative, but equally effective, security measure' that is approved by the DoD
contracting officer. And where a DoD contractor uses an external cloud service provider
to process, store, or transmit covered defense information, such provider must meet
security requirements that are equivalent to the FedRAMP Moderate baseline.

The following Microsoft Office 365 cloud services have received a FedRAMP moderate
authorization and are adequate for DFARS: Office 365 U.S. Government, and Office 365
U.S. Government Defense.

Also, Microsoft offerings outside the FedRAMP-certified boundary that could potentially
be used by DoD contractors to process, store, or transmit 'covered defense information'
are undergoing a review to meet a December 31, 2017, compliance deadline. Microsoft



is working to document how these internal and customer-facing services comply with
NIST SP 800-171 or an acceptable security equivalent, to meet the DFARS relevant
clauses.

Department of Defense (DoD) Impact
Level 2 (IL2)
Article • 12/07/2023

DoD IL2 overview
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is an agency of the US Department of
Defense (DoD) that is responsible for developing and maintaining the DoD Cloud
Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) . The SRG defines the baseline security
requirements used by DoD to assess the security posture of a cloud service provider
(CSP), supporting the decision to grant a DoD Provisional Authorization (PA) that allows
a CSP to host DoD missions. It incorporates, supersedes, and rescinds the previously
published DoD Cloud Security Model (CSM) and maps to the DoD Risk Management
Framework (RMF).

DISA guides DoD agencies and departments in planning and authorizing the use of a
CSP. It also evaluates CSP offerings for compliance with the SRG, an authorization
process whereby CSPs can furnish documentation outlining their compliance with DoD
standards. It issues DoD Provisional Authorizations (PAs) when appropriate, so DoD
agencies and supporting organizations can use cloud services without having to go
through a full approval process on their own, saving time and effort.

The 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo  regarding Updated Guidance on the
Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services states that 'FedRAMP will
serve as the minimum security baseline for all DoD cloud services'. The SRG uses the
FedRAMP Moderate baseline at all information impact levels (IL) and considers the High
Baseline at some.

SRG Section 5.1.1 DoD use of FedRAMP Security Controls states that IL2 information may
be hosted in a CSP that minimally holds a FedRAMP Moderate PA and a DoD Level 2 PA,
subject to compliance with the personnel security requirements outlined in Section
5.6.2. However, this approach does not alleviate the CSP from meeting other security
and integration requirements as required by the Mission Owner. According to SRG
Section 5.2.2.1 Impact Level 2 Location and Separation Requirements, DoD IL2 PA is
adequately covered by a FedRAMP Moderate PA such that the requirements will not be
additionally assessed for an IL2 PA.

Article • 12/07/2023

DoD IL5 overview
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is an agency of the US Department of
Defense (DoD) that is responsible for developing and maintaining the DoD Cloud
Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) . The SRG defines the baseline security
requirements used by DoD to assess the security posture of a cloud service provider
(CSP), supporting the decision to grant a DoD Provisional Authorization (PA) that allows
a CSP to host DoD missions. It incorporates, supersedes, and rescinds the previously
published DoD Cloud Security Model (CSM) and maps to the DoD Risk Management
Framework (RMF).

DISA guides DoD agencies and departments in planning and authorizing the use of a

process whereby CSPs can furnish documentation outlining their compliance with DoD
standards. It issues DoD Provisional Authorizations (PAs) when appropriate, so DoD
agencies and supporting organizations can use cloud services without having to go
through a full approval process on their own, saving time and effort.

According to SRG Section 3.2 Information Impact Levels, IL5 information covers:

Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that requires higher level of protection
than that afforded by IL4

The CUI Registry  provides specific categories of information that is under
protection by the Executive branch, for example, more than 20 category
groupings are included in the CUI category list .
NIST SP 800-171  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
Systems and Organizations is intended for use by federal agencies in contracts
or other agreements established with non-federal organizations.

National Security Systems (NSS)
NIST SP 800-59  Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National
Security System provides definitions of NSS.
CNSSI 1253  Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security
Systems provides guidance on the security standards that federal agencies
should apply to categorize national security information.



The 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo  regarding Updated Guidance on the
Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services states that 'FedRAMP will
serve as the minimum security baseline for all DoD cloud services'. The SRG uses the
FedRAMP Moderate baseline at all information impact levels (IL) and considers the High
Baseline at some.

SRG Section 5.1.1 DoD use of FedRAMP Security Controls states that a FedRAMP High PA,
supplemented with DoD FedRAMP+ controls and control enhancements (C/CEs) and
requirements in the SRG, are used to assess CSPs toward awarding a DoD PA at IL5. No
matter what C/CE baseline is used as the basis for a FedRAMP High PA, additional
considerations and/or requirements will need to be assessed and approved before a
DoD PA can be awarded at IL5. Specifically, SRG Section 5.1.2 DoD FedRAMP+ Security
Controls/Enhancements states in Table 2 that 10 additional C/CEs beyond the FedRAMP
High baseline are required for a DoD IL5 PA.

Moreover, according to SRG Section 5.2.2.3 IL5 Location and Separation Requirements,
the following requirements (among others) must be in place for a Level 5 PA:

Virtual/logical separation between DoD and Federal Government tenants /
missions is sufficient. Virtual/logical separation between tenant/mission systems is
required.
Physical separation from non-DoD/non-Federal Government tenants (that is,
public, local/state government tenants) is required.
The CSP restricts potential access to DoD's and the community's information to
CSP employees that are U.S. Citizens.

DoE 10 CFR Part 810
Article • 09/25/2022

DoE 10 CFR Part 810 overview
The US Department of Energy (DoE) export control regulation 10 CFR Part 810
implements section 57b.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954  (AEA), as amended by
section 302 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978  (NNPA). It is administered by
the National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA). The revised Part 810 (final rule)
became effective on 25 March 2015, and, among other things, it controls the export of
unclassified nuclear technology and assistance. It enables peaceful nuclear trade by
helping to assure that nuclear technologies exported from the United States will be used
only for peaceful purposes. Paragraph 810.7 (b) states that specific DoE authorization is
required for providing or transferring sensitive nuclear technology to any foreign entity.

Azure and DoE 10 CFR Part 810
Azure Government can accommodate customers subject to DoE 10 CFR Part 810 export
control requirements because it is designed to meet specific controls that restrict access
to information and systems to US persons among Azure operations personnel. Azure
Government also imposes background screening requirements mandated by US
Government on operations personnel with access to production systems. For more
information, see Screening and Azure support for export controls.

Aside from controls on operations personnel with access to production systems, Azure
Government maintains compliance with rigorous US Government assessments and
authorizations, including:

FedRAMP High provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO) issued by the
FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB)
US Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide
(SRG) Impact Level 5 (IL5) provisional authorization (PA) issued by the Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA)

FedRAMP and DoD provisional authorizations are based on the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53  controls. They include provisions for
penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, continuous monitoring, Plan of Action &
Milestones (POA&M), and so on, to provide assurances that assessed controls are
operating effectively.



If you're deploying applications and data to Azure Government, you're responsible for
your own security classification process. For data subject to DoE export controls, the
classification system is augmented by the Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information
(UCNI) controls established by Section 148 of the AEA.

Azure and U-NNPI
The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program  was created under Executive Order 12344
(see also 50 USC 2511 ). It comprises the military and civilian personnel who design,
build, operate, maintain, and manage the nuclear-powered ships and facilities that
support the US nuclear-powered naval fleet. The program provides the design,
development, and operational support required for effective military nuclear propulsion
plants, and ensures their safe, reliable, and long-lived operation.

Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI) that is designated as CUI is listed in the
CUI category list . Unclassified NNPI (U-NNPI) is marked Not Releasable to Foreign
Nationals (NOFORN), and it may not be released publicly or disclosed to foreign
nationals. Table 1 and Exhibit 1 in OPNAVINST N9210.3  Safeguarding of Naval Nuclear
Propulsion Information (NNPI) discuss the different classification levels/handling controls
for NNPI, including access requirements for U-NNPI. Azure Government can
accommodate U-NNPI workloads because it is designed to meet specific controls that
restrict access to information and systems to US persons among Azure operations
personnel. Azure Government also imposes background screening requirements
mandated by US Government on operations personnel with access to production
systems. For more information, see Screening and Azure support for export controls.
Moreover, an accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO) has attested that
Azure Government has implemented the security controls that are part of the Navy's
security overlay. For more information, see Azure NIST SP 800-171 documentation.

７ Note

You must contact Naval Reactors  (Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program) to obtain
authorization prior to hosting unclassified NNPI (U-NNPI) in Azure Government.

Frequently asked questions



How does NRC 10 CFR Part 110 relate to DoE 10 CFR Part 810?
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC) is responsible for the Export and import of
nuclear equipment and materials  under the 10 CFR Part 110  export control
regulations. The NRC regulates the export and import of nuclear facilities and related
equipment and materials. The NRC doesn't regulate nuclear technology and assistance
related to these items which are under the DoE jurisdiction. Consequently, the NRC 10
CFR Part 110 regulations wouldn't be applicable to Azure or Azure Government.

How can I supply evidence that I am complying with DoE 10 CFR Part 810?
If your organization is deploying data to Azure Government, you can rely on the Azure
Government FedRAMP High P-ATO as evidence that the underlying cloud services
platform is handling data in an appropriately restricted manner. However, you're
responsible for getting a DoE authorization for your own systems, including the use of
cloud services.

Can Azure Government accommodate U-NNPI?
Yes; however, you must contact Naval Reactors  (Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program) to
obtain authorization prior to hosting U-NNPI in Azure Government. Naval Nuclear
Propulsion Information (NNPI) that is designated as controlled unclassified information
(CUI) is listed in the CUI category list . Unclassified NNPI (U-NNPI) is marked Not
Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN), and may not be released publicly or
disclosed to foreign nationals. Azure Government can accommodate U-NNPI workloads
because it is designed to meet specific controls that restrict access to information and
systems to US persons among Azure operations personnel. Azure Government also
imposes background screening requirements mandated by US Government on
operations personnel with access to production systems. For more information, see
Screening and Azure support for export controls. Moreover, an accredited third-party
assessment organization (3PAO) has attested that Azure Government has implemented
the security controls that are part of the Navy's security overlay. For more information,
see Azure NIST SP 800-171 documentation.

What are my responsibilities for classifying data deployed to Azure Government?
If you're deploying data to Azure Government, you're responsible for your own security
classification process. For customer data subject to DoE export controls, the
classification system is augmented by the Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information
(UCNI) controls established by Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954  (AEA).

US Export Administration Regulations
(EAR)
07/15/2025

About the EAR
The US Department of Commerce enforces the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
through the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) . The EAR broadly governs and imposes
controls on the export and re-export of most commercial goods, software, and technology,
including 'dual-use' items that can be used both for commercial and military purposes and
certain defense items.

BIS guidance holds that, when data or software is uploaded to the cloud or transferred
between user nodes, the customer, not the cloud provider, is the 'exporter' who has the
responsibility to ensure that transfers of, storage of, and access to that data or software
complies with the EAR.

According to the BIS , export refers to the transfer of protected technology or technical data
to a foreign destination or its release to a foreign person in the United States (also referred to
as a deemed export). The EAR broadly governs:

Exports from the United States.
Re-exports or retransfers of US-origin items and certain foreign-origin items with more
than a de minimis portion of US-origin content.
Transfers or disclosures to persons from other countries/regions.

Items subject to the EAR can be found on the Commerce Control List (CCL) where each item is
assigned a unique Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) . Items not listed on the CCL
are designated as EAR99 and most EAR99 commercial products won't require a license to be
exported. However, depending on the destination, end user, or end use of the item, even an
EAR99 item may require a BIS export license.

The final rule , published in June 2016, clarified that EAR licensing requirements also wouldn't
apply to the transmission and storage of unclassified technical data and software if they were
encrypted end-to-end using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules and weren't
intentionally stored in a military-embargoed country/region or in the Russian Federation.

Microsoft and the EAR



Microsoft technologies, products, and services are subject to the US Export Administration
Regulations (EAR). While there's no compliance certification for the EAR, Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Azure Government, and Microsoft Office 365 Government (GCC High and DoD
environments) offer important features and tools to help eligible customers subject to the EAR
manage export control risks and meet their compliance requirements.

The US Commerce Department, which enforces the EAR, has taken the position that customers,
not cloud service providers such as Microsoft, are considered to be exporters of their own
customer data. While most customer data isn't considered 'technology' or 'technical data'
subject to EAR export controls, Microsoft in-scope cloud services are structured to help
customers manage and significantly mitigate the potential export control risks they face.
Microsoft generally, but not exclusively, recommends the use of its government cloud services
for eligible customers. With appropriate planning, customers can use the following tools and
their own internal procedures to help ensure full compliance with US export controls.

Controls on data location. Customers have visibility into where their data is stored and
access to robust tools to restrict its storage. They may therefore ensure that their data is
stored in the United States and minimize transfer of controlled technology or technical
data outside the United States. Furthermore, customer data isn't stored in a non-
conforming location, consistent with EAR prohibitions on where data is 'intentionally
stored': no Azure datacenter is located in any of the 25 Group D:5 countries/regions or
the Russian Federation.
End-to-end encryption. By taking advantage of the end-to-end encryption safe harbor
for physical storage locations specified in the EAR, Microsoft in-scope cloud services
deliver encryption features that can help protect against export control risks. They also
offer customers a wide range of options for encrypting data in transit and at rest, and the
flexibility to choose among encryption options. To learn more, see:

Azure encryption overview
Microsoft Purview Information Protection
Tenant-level encryption with Customer Key

Tools and protocols to prevent unauthorized deemed export. The use of encryption also
helps protect against a potential deemed export (or deemed re-export) under the EAR,
because even if a non-US person has access to encrypted data, nothing is revealed if they
can't read or understand the data while it's encrypted; thus there's no 'release' of
controlled data.

Frequently asked questions
What should I do to comply with export controls when using Microsoft cloud services?

Under the EAR, when data is uploaded to a cloud server such as the Microsoft cloud, the
customer who owns the data, not the cloud services provider, is considered to be the exporter.
For that reason, the owner of the data — that is, the Microsoft customer — must carefully
assess how their use of the Microsoft cloud may implicate US export controls and determine
whether any of the data they want to use or store there may be subject to EAR controls, and if
so, what controls apply. Learn more about how Azure and Office 365  cloud services can help
customers ensure their full compliance with US export controls. For more information, see the
Cloud FAQs section of the Frequently Asked Questions page at Exporting Microsoft Products .

Are Microsoft technologies, products, and services subject to the EAR?

Most Microsoft technologies, products, and services either:

Aren't subject to the EAR and thus aren't on the Commerce Control List and have no
ECCN;
Or they're EAR99 or 5D992 Mass Market-eligible for self-classification by Microsoft and
may be exported to non-embargoed countries/regions without a license as No License
Required (NLR).

That said, a few Microsoft products have been assigned an ECCN that may or may not require a
license. Consult the EAR or legal counsel to determine the appropriate license type and eligible
countries/regions for export purposes.

What's the difference between the EAR and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)?

The primary US export controls with the broadest application are the EAR, administered by the
US Department of Commerce. The EAR is applicable to dual-use items that have both
commercial and military applications, and to items with purely commercial applications.

The United States also has separate and more specialized export control regulations, such as
the ITAR, that governs the most sensitive items and technology. Administered by the US
Department of State, they impose controls on the export, temporary import, re-export, and
transfer of many military, defense, and intelligence items (also known as 'defense articles'),
including related technical data.

Federal Risk and Authorization
Management Program (FedRAMP)
Article • 09/27/2023

FedRAMP overview
The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) was
established to provide a standardized approach for assessing, monitoring, and
authorizing cloud computing products and services under the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), and to accelerate the adoption of secure cloud
solutions by federal agencies.

The Office of Management and Budget now requires all executive federal agencies to
use FedRAMP to validate the security of cloud services. (Other agencies have also
adopted it, so it's useful in other areas of the public sector as well.) The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53 sets the mandatory standards,
establish security categories of information systems—confidentiality, integrity, and
availability—to assess the potential impact on an organization should its information
and information systems be compromised. FedRAMP is the program that certifies that a
cloud service provider (CSP) meets those standards.

CSPs desiring to sell services to a federal agency can take three paths to demonstrate
FedRAMP compliance:

Earn a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board
(JAB). The JAB is the primary governance and decision-making body for FedRAMP.
Representatives from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland
Security, and the General Services Administration serve on the board. The board
grants a P-ATO to CSPs that have demonstrated FedRAMP compliance.
Receive an Authority to Operate (ATO) from a federal agency.
Or, work independently to develop a CSP Supplied Package that meets program
requirements.

Each of these paths requires a stringent technical review by the FedRAMP Program
Management Office (PMO) and an assessment by an independent third-party
organization that is accredited by the program.

FedRAMP authorizations are granted at three impact levels based on NIST guidelines—
low, medium, and high. These levels rank the impact that the loss of confidentiality,



integrity, or availability could have on an organization—low (limited effect), medium
(serious adverse effect), and high (severe or catastrophic effect).

Microsoft and FedRAMP
Microsoft's government cloud services, including Azure Government, Dynamics 365
Government, and Office 365 U.S. Government meet the demanding requirements of the
US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), enabling U.S.
federal agencies to benefit from the cost savings and rigorous security of the Microsoft
Cloud.

Microsoft government cloud services offer public sector customers a rich array of
services compliant with FedRAMP, and robust guidance and implementation tools,
including the FedRAMP High blueprint , which helps customers deploy a core set of
policies for any Azure-deployed architecture that must implement FedRAMP High
controls.

Office 365 U.S. Government Defense has a P-ATO from the US Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA). Any customer wishing to deploy Office 365 U.S.
Government Defense may use the DISA P‑ATO to generate an agency ATO to
document their acceptance of it.



Office 365 (enterprise and business plans) and Office 365 U.S. Government have a
FedRAMP Agency ATO at the Moderate Impact Level from the DHHS Office of the
Inspector General. Office 365 U.S. Government was the first cloud-based email and
collaboration service to obtain this authorization.

Office 365 audits, reports, and certificates
Microsoft is required to recertify its cloud services each year to maintain its P-ATOs and
ATOs. To do so, Microsoft must monitor and assess its security controls continuously,
and demonstrate that the security of its services remains in compliance.

Microsoft FedRAMP Audit Reports

Frequently asked questions
Do Microsoft cloud services comply with the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA)?

FISMA is the federal law that requires US federal agencies and their partners to procure
information systems and services only from organizations that adhere to FISMA
requirements. Most agencies and their vendors that indicate that they're FISMA-
compliant are referring to how they meet the controls identified by the NIST in Special



Publication 800-53 rev 4. The FISMA process (but not the underlying standards
themselves) was replaced by FedRAMP in 2011.

To whom does FedRAMP apply?

'FedRAMP is mandatory for federal agency cloud deployments and service models at
the low and moderate risk impact levels.' Any federal agency that wants to engage a
CSP may be required to meet FedRAMP specifications. In addition, companies that
employ cloud technologies in products or services used by the federal government may
be required to obtain an ATO.

Where does my agency start its own compliance effort?

For an overview of the steps federal agencies must take to successfully navigate
FedRAMP and meet its requirements, go to Get Authorized: Agency Authorization .

Can I use Microsoft compliance in my agency's authorization process?

Yes. You may use the certifications of Microsoft cloud services as the foundation for any
program or initiative that requires an ATO from a federal government agency. However,
you need to achieve your own authorizations for components outside these services.

Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2
Article • 12/07/2023

FIPS 140-2 standard overview
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 is a U.S.
government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic
modules in information technology products, as defined in Section 5131 of the
Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996.

The Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP), a joint effort of the U.S.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for
Cyber Security (CCCS), validates cryptographic modules to the Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules standard (i.e., FIPS 140-2) and related FIPS cryptography
standards. The FIPS 140-2 security requirements cover 11 areas related to the design
and implementation of a cryptographic module. The NIST Information Technology
Laboratory operates a related program that validates the FIPS approved cryptographic
algorithms in the module.

Microsoft's approach to FIPS 140-2 validation
Microsoft maintains an active commitment to meeting the 140-2 requirements, having
validated cryptographic modules since the standard's inception in 2001. Microsoft
validates its cryptographic modules under the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP). Multiple
Microsoft products, including many cloud services, use these cryptographic modules.

For technical information on Microsoft Windows cryptographic modules, the security
policy for each module, and the catalog of CMVP certificate details, see the Windows
and Windows Server FIPS 140-2 content .

Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services
While the current CMVP FIPS 140-2 implementation guidance precludes a FIPS 140-2
validation for a cloud service itself; cloud service providers can choose to obtain and
operate FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules for the computing elements that



comprise their cloud service. Microsoft online services that include components, which
have been FIPS 140-2 validated include, among others:

Azure and Azure Government

Frequently asked questions
What is the difference between 'FIPS 140 Validated' and 'FIPS 140 compliant'?

'FIPS 140 Validated' means that the cryptographic module, or a product that embeds the
module has been validated ('certified') by the CMVP as meeting the FIPS 140-2
requirements. 'FIPS 140 compliant' is an industry term for IT products that rely on FIPS
140 Validated products for cryptographic functionality.

When does Microsoft undertake a FIPS 140 validation?

The cadence for starting a module validation aligns with the feature updates of
Windows 10 and Windows Server. As the software industry evolved, operating systems
are released more frequently, with monthly software updates. Microsoft undertakes
validation for feature releases, but in between releases, seeks to minimize the changes
to the cryptographic modules.

Which computers are included in a FIPS 140 validation?

Microsoft validates cryptographic modules on a representative sample of hardware
configurations running Windows 10 and Windows Server. It is common industry practice



to accept this FIPS 140-2 validation when an environment uses hardware, which is
similar to the samples used for the validation process.

There are many modules listed on the NIST website. How do I know which one
applies to my agency?

If you are required to use cryptographic modules validated through FIPS 140-2, you
need to verify that the version you use appears on the validation list. The CMVP and
Microsoft maintain a list of validated cryptographic modules, organized by product
release, along with instructions for identifying which modules are installed on a
Windows system. For more information on configuring systems to be compliant, see the
Windows and Windows Server FIPS 140-2 content .

What does 'When operated in FIPS mode' mean on a certificate?

This caveat informs the reader that required configuration and security rules must be
followed to use the cryptographic module in a way that is consistent with its FIPS 140-2
security policy. Each module has its own security policy — a precise specification of the
security rules under which it will operate — and employs approved cryptographic
algorithms, cryptographic key management, and authentication techniques. The security
rules are defined in the security policy for each module. For more information, including
links to the security policy for each module validated through the CMVP, see the
Windows and Windows Server FIPS 140-2 content .

Does FedRAMP require FIPS 140-2 validation?

Yes, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) relies on
control baselines defined by the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 , including SC-13
Cryptographic Protection  mandating the use of FIPS-validated cryptography or NSA-
approved cryptography.

Can I use Microsoft's adherence to FIPS 140-2 in my agency's certification process?

To comply with FIPS 140-2, your system must be configured to run in a FIPS approved
mode of operation, which includes ensuring that a cryptographic module uses only
FIPS-approved algorithms. For more information on configuring systems to be
compliant, see the Windows and Windows Server FIPS 140-2 content .

What is the relationship between FIPS 140-2 and Common Criteria?

These are two separate security standards with different, but complementary, purposes.
FIPS 140-2 is designed specifically for validating software and hardware cryptographic
modules, while the Common Criteria is designed to evaluate security functions in IT
software and hardware products. Common Criteria evaluations often rely on FIPS 140-2



validations to provide assurance that basic cryptographic functionality is implemented
properly.

US Internal Revenue Service Publication
1075
Article • 03/16/2023

US Internal Revenue Service Publication 1075
overview
Internal Revenue Service Publication 1075 (IRS 1075) provides guidance for US
government agencies and their agents that access federal tax information (FTI) to ensure
that they use policies, practices, and controls to protect its confidentiality. IRS 1075 aims
to minimize the risk of loss, breach, or misuse of FTI held by external government
agencies. For example, a state Department of Revenue that processes FTI in tax returns
for its residents, or health services agencies that access FTI, must have programs in place
to safeguard that information.

To protect FTI, IRS 1075 prescribes security and privacy controls for application,
platform, and datacenter services. For instance, it prioritizes the security of datacenter
activities, such as the proper handling of FTI, and the oversight of datacenter contractors
to limit entry. To ensure that government agencies receiving FTI apply those controls,
the IRS established the Safeguards Program, which includes periodic reviews of these
agencies and their contractors.

Microsoft and US Internal Revenue Service
Publication 1075
Microsoft Azure Government and Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government  cloud
services provide a contractual commitment that they have the appropriate controls in
place, and the security capabilities necessary for Microsoft agency customers to meet
the substantive requirements of IRS 1075.

These Microsoft cloud services for government provide a platform on which customers
can build and operate their solutions, but customers must determine for themselves
whether those specific solutions are operated in accordance with IRS 1075 and are,
therefore, subject to IRS audit.

To help government agencies in their compliance efforts, Microsoft:



Offers detailed guidance to help agencies understand their responsibilities and
how various IRS controls map to capabilities in Azure Government and Office 365
U.S. Government. The IRS 1075 Safeguard Security Report (SSR) thoroughly
documents how Microsoft services implement the applicable IRS controls, and is
based on the FedRAMP packages of Azure Government and Office 365 U.S.
Government. Because both IRS 1075 and FedRAMP are based on NIST 800-53, the
compliance boundary for IRS 1075 is the same as the FedRAMP authorization.
The IRS must explicitly approve the release of any IRS Safeguards document, so
only government customers under NDA can review the SSR.
Makes available audit reports and monitoring information produced by
independent assessors for its cloud services.
Provides to the IRS Azure Government Compliance Considerations and Office 365
U.S. Government Compliance Considerations, which outline how an agency can use
Microsoft Cloud for Government services in a way that complies with IRS 1075.
Government customers under NDA can request these documents.
Offers customers the opportunity (at their expense) to communicate with
Microsoft subject matter experts or outside auditors if needed.

Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services
FedRAMP authorizations are granted at three impact levels based on NIST guidelines—
low, medium, and high. These rank the impact that the loss of confidentiality, integrity,
or availability could have on an organization—low (limited effect), medium (serious
adverse effect), and high (severe or catastrophic effect).

International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR)
Article • 12/07/2023

ITAR overview
The US Department of State is responsible for managing the export and temporary
import of defense articles (meaning any item or technical data designated under the US
Munitions List, as described in Title 22 CFR 121.1) that are governed by the Arms Export
Control Act (Title 22 USC 2778) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
(Title 22 CFR 120-130). The Directorate for Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) is responsible
for managing entities governed under these programs.

Microsoft and ITAR
Microsoft provides certain cloud services or service features that can support customers
with ITAR obligations. While there is no compliance certification for the ITAR, Microsoft
operates and has designed in-scope services to be capable of supporting a customer's
ITAR obligations and compliance program.

Microsoft Azure Government and Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government for Defense
provide support for customers with data subject to the ITAR through additional
contractual commitments to customers regarding the location of stored data, and
limitations on the ability to access such data to US persons. Microsoft provides these
assurances for the infrastructure and operational components of these government
cloud services, but customers are ultimately responsible for the protection and
architecture of their applications within their environments.

Customers must sign additional agreements formally notifying Microsoft of their
intention to store ITAR-controlled data, so that Microsoft may comply with
responsibilities both to our customers and to the US government.

The ITAR has specific obligations to report violations, which can provide certain risk
mitigation benefits. The Microsoft Enterprise Agreement Amendment enables Microsoft
and the customer to work together in reporting such violations.

Customers seeking to host ITAR-regulated data should work with their Microsoft
account and licensing teams to learn more, obtain proper agreements, and access
relevant system architecture information.

National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA)
Article • 10/10/2022

NDAA Section 889 overview
Section 889 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) prohibits US
federal government agencies, contractors, and grant and loan recipients from procuring
or using certain covered telecommunications equipment and services as described in the
statute. NDAA Section 889 seeks to mitigate privacy and security risks to US government
by prohibiting the purchase and use of such equipment. These prohibitions were
implemented in two phases:

Section 889(a)(1)(A) prohibits federal agencies from purchasing covered
telecommunications equipment and services. It became effective on 13 August
2019. The US Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration
(GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued two
interim rules amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement
Section 889(a)(1)(A). For more information, see interim rule 1  and interim rule
2 .
Section 889(a)(1)(B) prohibits federal agencies from entering into, or extending or
renewing, a contract with a company that uses covered telecommunications
equipment and services. It became effective on 13 August 2020, and it has much
broader scope than the first phase. It's aimed at ensuring that US government
doesn't conduct business with companies that use covered telecommunications
equipment and services. DoD, GSA, and NASA issued an interim rule  amending
the FAR to implement Section 889(a)(1)(B).

The detailed definition of covered telecommunications equipment and services is
provided in the statute as follows:

(A) Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company
or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).
(B) For the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical
security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes,
video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera
Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company,
or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).



(C) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or
using such equipment.
(D) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or
provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the
Director of the National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or
otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country.

Microsoft support for NDAA Section 889
For purposes of NDAA Section 889(a)(1)(B), Microsoft understands that its partners and
customers are conducting “reasonable inquiries“ regarding their use of prohibited
covered telecommunications equipment and services. Microsoft Azure, Office 365,
Dynamics 365, and Surface current products and services offerings in the United States
don't use equipment or services of Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation,
Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology
Company, or Dahua Technology Company.

NDAA Section 1634 overview
On 15 June 2018, DoD, GSA, and NASA published an interim rule in the Federal Register
to revise the FAR to implement section 1634 of Division A of the NDAA, which prohibits
the use of products and services of Kaspersky Lab and its related entities by the Federal
Government. Among other things, the interim rule added a corresponding contract
clause at 52.204-23  that must be included by contracting officers in solicitations
issued on or after 16 July 2018, and in resulting contracts.

Microsoft support for NDAA Section 1634
For purposes of FAR 52.204-23, Microsoft cloud services, including Azure, Dynamics 365,
Microsoft 365, and Power Platform, don't use any hardware, software, or services
provided by Kaspersky Lab.

Frequently asked questions
What are covered telecommunications equipment and services?
Detailed definitions are provided in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), as mentioned in the Overview section previously.



Does FedRAMP require compliance with Section 889 of the NDAA?
Yes. Effective 20 May 2021, the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) updated the
SA-04 control parameter  within the Low, Moderate, and High baselines, specifying
that the cloud service providers must comply with Section 889 of the NDAA. Control SA-
04 Acquisition Process  is part of the System and Services Acquisition (SA) control
family. Both Azure and Azure Government maintain a FedRAMP High Provisional
Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) issued by the JAB.

Do NDAA Section 889 assurances apply to Microsoft online services outside the
United States?
No. The commitment exists only for service offerings in the United States. NDAA Section
889 restrictions are applicable only to procurement by US federal government agencies,
contractors, and grant loan recipients.

Azure NIST SP 800-161 documentation for supply chain risk management



NIST SP 800-161
Article • 04/05/2023

NIST SP 800-161 overview
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-161  Cybersecurity
Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations provides
guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating information and
communications technology (ICT) supply chain risks throughout their organizations. This
publication integrates ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM) into federal agency
risk management activities. The processes and controls described in the publication
build on federal agency guidance, and are intended for federal agencies to consider and
implement. While entities outside of the federal government may decide to consult NIST
SP 800-161 as a source of good practices, the publication doesn't contain any specific
guidance for those entities, such as cloud service providers.

Azure and NIST SP 800-161
The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) was
established to provide a standardized approach for assessing, monitoring, and
authorizing cloud computing products and services. FedRAMP is based on the NIST SP
800-53  standard, augmented by FedRAMP controls and control enhancements. Both
Azure and Azure Government maintain a FedRAMP High Provisional Authorization to
Operate (P-ATO) issued by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB).

The System and Services Acquisition  (SA) control family that's part of the NIST SP 800-
53 control baseline, provides control coverage for supply chain risk assessments. For
example, the SA-12 control  is focused specifically on supply chain protection and is
included in the FedRAMP High control baseline.

An accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO) has attested that Azure
implementation of the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 supply chain controls, SA-12  and SA-
19 , is in alignment with the NIST SP 800-161 guidelines. Based on the 3PAO analysis,
NIST SP 800-161 maps closely to security controls SA-12 and SA-19, which were tested
as part of the Azure Government assessment conducted for the US Department of
Defense (DoD). The assessment of SA-12 and SA-19 controls was conducted using NIST
SP 800-53A Rev. 4 assessment procedures.

Microsoft’s supply chain processes are implemented at a programmatic level and
applicable across the board for all Azure systems. Based on the 3PAO's review of the SA-



12 and SA-19 security controls, Microsoft's supply chain best practices are built into the
procurement process to prevent and mitigate ICT supply chain risks, such as insertion of
counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software
and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the ICT supply
chain. Moreover, Microsoft has implemented anti-counterfeit policies and procedures to
detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the Azure system.

Microsoft Azure also maintains authoritative lists of approved software through its
Definitive Software Library (DSL) to ensure that software updates are provisioned only
from approved sources. In the event any counterfeit components are detected, Azure
follows the standard incident handling and reporting procedures and mechanisms
established for security incidents. Using the assessment data, the 3PAO attested that the
Azure cloud service offering (CSO) is in compliance with the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 SA-
12 and SA-19 security controls, and aligned with NIST SP 800-161 ICT SCRM SA-12 and
SA-19 supplemental guidance for federal agencies.

Supplier privacy and assurance standards
Hardware supply chain
Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)

Should I use Azure or Azure Government for workloads that need to be aligned with
NIST SP 800-161?
You're wholly responsible for ensuring your own compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations, and should consult your legal advisor for questions regarding regulatory
compliance. Azure and Azure Government have the same security controls in place,
including the same controls for supply chain risk management. The cloud environment
decision will rest with you based on your business requirements. Most US government
agencies and their partners are best aligned with Azure Government, which provides an
extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding



storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems
processing customer data to screened US persons.

NIST SP 800-171
Article • 11/03/2023

About NIST SP 800-171
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes and maintains
measurement standards and guidelines to help protect the information and information
systems of federal agencies. In response to Executive Order 13556 on managing
controlled unclassified information (CUI), it published NIST SP 800-171 , Protecting
Controlled Unclassified Information In Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations.
CUI is defined as information, both digital and physical, created by a government (or an
entity on its behalf) that, while not classified, is still sensitive and requires protection.

NIST SP 800-171 was originally published in June 2015 and has been updated several
times since then in response to evolving cyberthreats. It provides guidelines on how CUI
should be securely accessed, transmitted, and stored in nonfederal information systems
and organizations; its requirements fall into four main categories:

Controls and processes for managing and protecting
Monitoring and management of IT systems
Clear practices and procedures for end users
Implementation of technological and physical security measures

Microsoft and NIST SP 800-171
Accredited third-party assessment organizations, Kratos Secureinfo and Coalfire,
partnered with Microsoft to attest that its in-scope cloud services meet the criteria in
NIST SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal
Information Systems and Organizations, when they process CUI. The Microsoft
implementation of FedRAMP requirements help ensure Microsoft in-scope cloud
services meet or exceed the requirements of NIST SP 800-171 using the systems and
practices already in place.

NIST SP 800-171 requirements are a subset of NIST SP 800-53, the standard that
FedRAMP uses. Appendix D of NIST SP 800-171 provides a direct mapping of its CUI
security requirements to the relevant security controls in NIST SP 800-53, for which the
in-scope cloud services have already been assessed and authorized under the FedRAMP
program.



Any entity that processes or stores US government CUI — research institutions,
consulting companies, manufacturing contractors, must comply with the stringent
requirements of NIST SP 800-171. This attestation means Microsoft in-scope cloud
services can accommodate customers looking to deploy CUI workloads with the
assurance that Microsoft is in full compliance. For example, all DoD contractors who
process, store, or transmit 'covered defense information' using in-scope Microsoft cloud
services in their information systems meet the US Department of Defense DFARS clauses
that require compliance with the security requirements of NIST SP 800-171.

Article • 09/25/2022

The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) was
established to provide a standardized approach for assessing, monitoring, and
authorizing cloud computing products and services. FedRAMP is based on the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53  standard, augmented by
FedRAMP controls and control enhancements. For more information about Azure
support for NIST SP 800-53 controls, see Azure FedRAMP documentation.

７ Note

NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4  was withdrawn on 23 September 2021 and superseded by
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 .

Azure Policy regulatory compliance built-in
initiatives
For extra customer assistance, Microsoft provides the Azure Policy regulatory
compliance built-in initiatives for Azure and Azure Government, which map to NIST SP
800-53 compliance domains and controls:

Azure
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 Azure regulatory compliance built-in initiative
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Azure regulatory compliance built-in initiative

Azure Government
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 Azure Government regulatory compliance built-in
initiative
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Azure Government regulatory compliance built-in
initiative

Regulatory compliance in Azure Policy provides built-in initiative definitions to view a list
of controls and compliance domains based on responsibility – customer, Microsoft, or
shared. For Microsoft-responsible controls, we provide extra audit result details based
on third-party attestations and our control implementation details to achieve that
compliance. Each NIST SP 800-53 control is associated with one or more Azure Policy
definitions. These policies may help you assess compliance with the control; however,



compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. Azure
Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale.
Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the
overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to more granular status.

Microsoft Sentinel NIST SP 800-53 solution
Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud service that provides intelligent security analytics and
threat intelligence across the enterprise. To help you address NIST SP 800-53 control
requirements at scale, Microsoft provides the Microsoft Sentinel NIST SP 800-53
solution , which can help you gain situational awareness regarding your security
posture. The solution delivers a single pane of glass for aggregating and managing data
at scale to provide maximum visibility into cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud
workloads.

The solution contains:

Workbook – Provides a dashboard that relies on Azure Policy, Azure Resource
Graph, and Azure Monitor Log Analytics to align with NIST SP 800-53 control
requirements across Azure, Microsoft 365, multi-cloud, on-premises, and hybrid

NIST SP 800-63
Article • 02/15/2023

NIST SP 800-63 overview
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-63  Digital Identity
Guidelines provides technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
identity services, including identity proofing and authentication of users interacting with
government IT systems over open networks. Moreover, healthcare, financial services,
and other industries often rely on the NIST SP 800-63 as a baseline for identity and
access management requirements. For example, NIST SP 800-63 is referenced by:

The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Electronic Prescriptions for
Controlled Substances  (EPCS)
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) notice on multi-factor
authentication

NIST SP 800-63 guidelines are referenced in other standards, most notably the US
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) that is applicable to
cloud service providers (CSPs). FedRAMP is based on the NIST SP 800-53  standard,
augmented by FedRAMP controls and control enhancements. Several FedRAMP controls
in the Identification and Authentication  (IA) control family reference NIST SP 800-63,
for example, IA-1, IA-5, and IA-8.

NIST SP 800-63 guidelines encompass three areas, and each area sets requirements to
achieve a given level of assurance:

SP 800-63A Enrollment and Identity Proofing  sets requirements to achieve a
given Identity Assurance Level (IAL): IAL1, IAL2, and IAL3.
SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management  addresses how an
individual can securely authenticate to credential service provider to access a
digital service at a given Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL): AAL1, AAL2, and
AAL3.
SP 800-63C Federation and Assertions  provides requirements when using
federated identities and assertions to convey the result of authentication at a given
Federation Assurance Level (FAL): FAL1, FAL2, and FAL3.

Azure support for NIST SP 800-63



Azure provides guidance for attaining the NIST SP 800-63B Authenticator Assurance
Levels by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and other Microsoft solutions. For
more information, see Achieving NIST AALs.

The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) was
established to provide a standardized approach for assessing, monitoring, and
authorizing cloud computing products and services. Both Azure and Azure Government
maintain a FedRAMP High Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) issued by the
FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB). For federal systems hosted on Azure, the
remote authentication of end users should follow NIST SP 800-63 guidelines. A cloud
service provider (CSP) system owner is responsible for selecting the right authentication
technology to meet the target assurance level. Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP
High authorizations satisfy the security and privacy control requirements for all
Authenticator Assurance Levels, including AAL1, AAL2, and AAL3.

７ Note

Extra resources:

For a review of authenticator basics, including authentication factors and
single-factor vs. multi-factor authentication, see Authenticator basics.
For more information on authenticator types and Microsoft methods, see
NIST authenticator types and aligned Azure AD methods.
For detailed information about authentication methods, including Windows
Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator App, and FIDO2 security key, see
What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure AD?

According to NIST SP 800-63B Section 4.3 , Authenticator Assurance Level 3 (AAL3)
authentication shall use a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that
provides verifier impersonation resistance – the same device may fulfill both
requirements. Possible combinations of authenticators satisfying AAL3 requirements
include:

Multi-factor cryptographic device
Single-factor cryptographic device used in conjunction with memorized secret
Multi-factor one-time password (OTP) device (software or hardware) used in
conjunction with a single-factor cryptographic device
Multi-factor OTP device (hardware only) used in conjunction with a single-factor
cryptographic software
Single-factor OTP device (hardware only) used in conjunction with a multi-factor
cryptographic software authenticator



Single-factor OTP device (hardware only) used in conjunction with a single-factor
cryptographic software authenticator and a memorized secret

We recommend using a multi-factor cryptographic hardware authenticator to achieve
AAL3, as explained in Achieving NIST AAL3 with Azure AD. Password is the greatest
attack surface that can be eliminated with Passwordless authentication, which offers
users a streamlined method to authenticate.

According to NIST SP 800-63B Section 4.3, multi-factor authenticators used at AAL3
shall rely on hardware cryptographic modules validated at FIPS 140 Level 2 or higher
overall level with at least FIPS 140 Level 3 for physical security. Verifiers at AAL3 shall be
validated at FIPS 140 Level 1 or higher. For more information about Microsoft support
for authenticator and verifier FIPS 140 validation requirements, see FIPS 140 validation.

FIDO2 security keys, smartcards, and Windows Hello for Business can help you meet
AAL3 requirements, including the requisite FIPS 140 validation:

FIDO2 security keys are well suited to organizations that are completely cloud
based. You can choose FIPS 140 validated security keys that meet AAL3
requirements .
Smartcards are an established technology with multiple vendors meeting FIPS 140
validation requirements .
Windows Hello for Business relies on multiple components in the FIPS 140
cryptographic boundary. For more information on conducting a risk assessment
when using Windows Hello for Business as an AAL3 authenticator, see
Authenticator requirements.

How to configure controls in the Access Control (AC) and Identification and
Authentication (IA) control families to meet FedRAMP High requirements. For more
information, see Configure Azure AD to meet FedRAMP High.



Frequently asked questions
Can Azure support my NIST AAL3 requirements?
Yes. Azure AD supports both authenticator and verifier NIST AAL3 requirements,
including FIPS 140 validation at the right level mandated by NIST SP 800-63B. We
recommend using a multi-factor cryptographic hardware authenticator to achieve AAL3.
FIDO2 security keys, smartcards, and Windows Hello for Business can help you meet
AAL3 requirements.

National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
Framework (CSF)
Article • 12/07/2023

NIST CSF overview
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes and maintains
measurement standards and guidance to help organizations assess risk. In response to
Executive Order 13636 on strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and
critical infrastructure, NIST released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity (FICIC) in February 2014.

The main priorities of the FICIC were to establish a set of standards and practices to help
organizations manage cybersecurity risk, while enabling business efficiency. The NIST
Framework addresses cybersecurity risk without imposing additional regulatory
requirements for both government and private sector organizations.

The FICIC references globally recognized standards including NIST SP 800-53 found in
Appendix A of the NIST's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity . Each control within the FICIC framework is mapped to corresponding
NIST 800-53 controls within the FedRAMP Moderate Baseline.

Microsoft and the NIST CSF
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary Framework that consists of standards,
guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risks. Microsoft Cloud
services have undergone independent, third-party FedRAMP Moderate and High
Baseline audits and are certified according to the FedRAMP standards. Also, through a
validated assessment performed by HITRUST, a leading security and privacy standards
development and accreditation organization, Office 365 is certified to the objectives
specified in the NIST CSF.

4. Resources

TISAX overview
The Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) is administered by the
ENX Association  on behalf of the German Association of the Automotive Industry
(Verband der Automobilindustrie , VDA).

VDA developed an information security assessment (ISA) as a catalog of criteria for
assessing information security. The VDA ISA is based on the ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC
27002 standards adapted to the automotive industry. In 2017, the VDA assessment was
updated to cover controls for the use of cloud services.

VDA member companies used the ISA both for internal security assessments and for
assessments of suppliers, service providers, and other partners that process sensitive
information on their behalf. However, because these evaluations were handled
individually by each company, they created a burden on partners and duplicated efforts
on the part of VDA members.

To help streamline security evaluations, VDA set up TISAX, which is used by European
automotive companies to provide a common information security assessment for
internal analysis, evaluation of suppliers, and information exchange. The ENX
Association  is responsible for TISAX implementation - it accredits auditors, maintains
the accreditation criteria and assessment requirements, and monitors the quality of
implementation and assessment results.

The TISAX control scope is documented in the latest VDA ISA catalogue available from
VDA Publications .

Azure and TISAX



An independent ENX-accredited auditor completed the TISAX assessment of Microsoft
datacenter infrastructure regions  against TISAX specifications and IT security
requirements. These TISAX certified regions provide the physical infrastructure for
Microsoft online services, including Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365, that are
described in the assessment report.

If you're an automotive company interested in cloud adoption, you can evaluate the
Microsoft TISAX assessment to create cloud solutions that benefit from strong
information security and data protection. You can use Azure and other Microsoft cloud
services, and exchange data with suppliers who are also TISAX compliant.

TISAX Assessment Level 3 (AL3)
AL3 is required for data with a very high need for protection, such as data classified as
strictly confidential or secret, data from crash test and flow simulations, and artificial
intelligence (AI) systems. The corresponding audit for AL3 included a thorough
verification of security processes, comprehensive onsite inspection, and in-person
interviews. The following Microsoft regions have been verified for TISAX AL3 with data
protection module:

Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA)
Article • 11/04/2024

FERPA overview
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a US federal law that protects
the privacy of students' education records, including personally identifiable and
directory information. FERPA was enacted to ensure that parents and students age 18
and older can access those records, request changes to them, and control the disclosure
of information, except in specific and limited cases where FERPA allows for disclosure
without consent.

The law applies to schools, school districts, and any other institution that receives
funding from the US Department of Education—that is, virtually all public K-12 schools
and school districts, as well as most post-secondary institutions, both public and private.

Security is central to compliance with FERPA, which requires the protection of student
information from unauthorized disclosures. Educational institutions that use cloud
computing need contractual reassurances that a technology vendor manages sensitive
student data appropriately.

Microsoft and FERPA
FERPA doesn't require or recognize audits or other certifications, so any academic
institution that is subject to FERPA must assess for itself whether and how its use of a
cloud service affects its ability to comply with FERPA requirements. In the Online
Services Terms Data Protection Addendum  (DPA), Microsoft agrees to be designated
as a 'school official' with 'legitimate educational interests' in customer data as defined
under FERPA. Customer data would include any student records provided through a
school's use of Azure. When Microsoft handles student education records, Microsoft
agrees to abide by the limitations and requirements imposed by 34 CFR 99.33(a) just as
school officials do. Microsoft has published guidance documentation to assist Azure
customers with satisfying their FERPA compliance requirements.

Frequently asked questions
Why is FERPA important?

This US federal law mandates the protection of the privacy of students' education
records. It also gives parents and eligible students access to those records and the
ability to correct them, as well as certain rights related to the release of records to third
parties.

What compliance implications do COPPA and CIPA have on Azure?

COPPA and CIPA are additional laws intended to protect the privacy of children;
however, they aren't directly applicable to Azure. The Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) is a U.S. federal law enacted to protect the privacy of children
under 13. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) manages COPPA. COPPA applies to
websites and online services directed to children and stipulates that these sites and
services must require parental consent for the collection and use of any personal
information belonging to children. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was
enacted to address concerns about children's access to harmful content over the
Internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules implementing
CIPA and defined requirements for schools and libraries subject to CIPA. Customers with
questions about COPPA and CIPA in the context of Azure adoption should review the
section titled Educational Institutions in the Online Services Terms DPA  where we
explain that customers are responsible for obtaining any parental consent for any end
user's use of Microsoft online services.

North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC)
Article • 04/20/2023

NERC overview
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation  (NERC) is a nonprofit regulatory
authority whose mission is to ensure the reliability of the North American bulk power
system. NERC is subject to oversight by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) and governmental authorities in Canada. In 2006, FERC granted the Electric
Reliability Organization (ERO) designation to NERC in accordance with the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 (US Public Law 109-58). NERC develops and enforces reliability standards
known as NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards .

If you're a bulk power system owner, operator, or user, you must comply with NERC CIP
standards . You're also required to register with NERC. Cloud service providers and
third-party vendors aren't subject to NERC CIP standards; however, the CIP standards
include goals that should be considered when registered entities  use vendors in the
operation of the Bulk Electric System (BES).

As stated by NERC in the current set of CIP standards  and NERC’s Glossary of Terms ,
BES Cyber Assets perform real-time functions of monitoring or controlling the BES, and
would affect the reliable operation of the BES within 15 minutes of being impaired. To
properly accommodate BES Cyber Assets and Protected Cyber Assets in a cloud
environment, existing definitions in NERC CIP standards would need to be revised .
However, there are many workloads that deal with CIP sensitive data and don't fall
under the 15-minute rule, including the broad category of BES Cyber System
Information (BCSI).

Azure and NERC CIP standards
If you're operating a Bulk Electric System (BES), you're wholly responsible for ensuring
your own compliance with NERC CIP standards. Neither Azure nor Azure Government
constitutes a BES or BES Cyber Asset; however, both Azure and Azure Government are
suitable for registered entities deploying certain workloads subject to compliance with
NERC CIP standards, including BCSI workloads.

If you're a registered entity interested in deploying data and workloads subject to NERC
CIP compliance obligations in Azure or Azure Government, you should review the



following documents:

NERC CIP standards and cloud computing discusses compliance considerations for
NERC CIP requirements based on established third-party audits that are applicable
to cloud service providers such as FedRAMP. It covers background screening for
cloud operations personnel, and answers common question about logical isolation
and multi-tenancy that may be of interest to you. It also addresses security
considerations for on-premises vs. cloud deployments.
Cloud implementation guide for NERC audits  is a guidance document that
provides control mapping between the current set of NERC CIP standards
requirements and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP
800-53  control set that forms the basis for FedRAMP. It is written as a technical
how-to guidance to help you address NERC CIP compliance requirements for your
Azure assets. The document contains pre-filled Reliability Standard Audit
Worksheets  (RSAWs) narratives that help explain how Azure controls address
NERC CIP requirements. It also contains guidance to help you use Azure services to
implement controls that you own. You can download the Cloud implementation
guide for NERC audits under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) from the Service
Trust Portal (STP). You must sign in to access this document on the STP. For more
information, see Get started with Microsoft Service Trust Portal .

７ Note

Information in this article, including all referenced guidance documents, is directly
applicable to Azure only. For example, you should review this information if you're
planning to deploy BCSI in Azure services or design an Azure application and
deploy it on Azure or Azure Government. If you're interested in deploying BCSI in
Office 365 (Microsoft 365), contact your Microsoft account team for assistance.

BCSI guidance
The NERC ERO Enterprise released  a Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement
Program (CMEP) practice guide  to provide guidance to ERO Enterprise CMEP staff
when assessing a registered entity’s process to authorize access to designated BCSI
storage locations and any access controls the registered entity implemented. Moreover,
NERC reviewed the Azure control implementation details and FedRAMP audit evidence
related to NERC CIP-004-6 and CIP-011-2 standards that are applicable to BCSI.

Based on the ERO issued practice guide and reviewed FedRAMP controls to ensure
registered entities encrypt their data, no additional guidance or clarification is needed
for registered entities to deploy BCSI and associated workloads in the cloud. However, if



you're a registered entity subject to NERC CIP compliance obligations, you're ultimately
responsible for compliance with NERC CIP standards according to your own facts and
circumstances. You should review the Cloud implementation guide for NERC audits  for
help with documenting your processes and evidence used to authorize electronic access
to BCSI storage locations, including encryption key management used for BCSI
encryption in Azure and Azure Government.

Registered entities storing or processing BCSI on Azure or Azure Government should
review pre-filled RSAW narratives for NERC CIP-004-6 and CIP-011-2 standards that are
documented in the Cloud implementation guide for NERC audits .

Applicability
Azure
Azure Government

Attestation documents
Microsoft relies on Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP audits to furnish assurances
to NERC registered entities that cloud controls relevant to NERC CIP standards
requirements are operating effectively. Azure and Azure Government maintain FedRAMP
High provisional authorizations to operate (P-ATO) issued by the Joint Authorization
Board (JAB) in addition to more than 400 Moderate and High ATOs issued by individual
federal agencies for the in-scope services. And while FedRAMP High in the Azure public
cloud will meet the needs of many customers, Azure Government provides extra
customer assurances through controls that limit potential access to systems processing
customer data to screened US persons.

For access to Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP documentation, see FedRAMP
attestation documents.

Frequently asked questions
Who is responsible for compliance with NERC CIP standards?
If you're a bulk power system owner, operator, or user, you must comply with NERC CIP
standards . You're also required to register with NERC. Cloud service providers and
third-party vendors aren't subject to NERC CIP standards; however, the CIP standards
include goals that should be considered when registered entities  use vendors in the
operation of the Bulk Electric System (BES). If you're operating a BES, you're wholly



responsible for ensuring your own compliance with NERC CIP standards. Neither Azure
nor Azure Government constitutes a BES or BES Cyber Asset.

How do NERC registered entities receive compliance assurances that cloud controls
are operating effectively?
If you're a registered entity subject to NERC CIP compliance obligations, you're expected
to rely on existing Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP authorizations as assurance
that cloud controls owned by Microsoft and pertinent to NERC CIP requirements have
been assessed and authorized by FedRAMP. It would be infeasible for a cloud service
provider (CSP) to submit to a NERC audit and furnish control evidence each time a
registered entity underwent a NERC audit. Rather, a CSP's existing FedRAMP
authorization provides assurances that NIST-based control evidence produced by the
CSP and mapped to NERC CIP requirements has already been examined by an
accredited FedRAMP auditor. You and your NERC CIP auditor are expected to rely on
FedRAMP authorizations rather than conduct your own individual audits of Azure or
Azure Government.

What workloads can Registered Entities deploy on Azure and Azure Government?
BES Cyber Assets perform real-time functions of monitoring or controlling the BES – if
impaired they would, within 15 minutes, affect the reliable operation of the BES. To
properly accommodate BES Cyber Assets and Protected Cyber Assets in a cloud
environment, existing definitions in NERC CIP standards would need to be revised.
However, there are many workloads that deal with CIP sensitive data and don't fall
under the 15-minute rule, including the broad category of BES Cyber System
Information (BCSI).

The NERC ERO Enterprise released  a Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement
Program (CMEP) practice guide  to provide guidance to ERO Enterprise CMEP staff
when assessing a registered entity’s process to authorize access to designated BCSI
storage locations and any access controls the registered entity implemented. Moreover,
NERC reviewed Azure control implementation details and FedRAMP audit evidence
related to NERC CIP-004-6 and CIP-011-2 standards that are applicable to BCSI.

Based on the ERO issued practice guide and reviewed FedRAMP controls to ensure
registered entities encrypt their data, no additional guidance or clarification is needed
for registered entities to deploy BCSI and associated workloads in the cloud. However, if
you're a registered entity subject to NERC CIP compliance obligations, you're ultimately
responsible for compliance with NERC CIP standards according to your own facts and
circumstances. You should review the Cloud implementation guide for NERC audits  for
help with documenting your processes and evidence used to authorize electronic access
to BCSI storage locations, including encryption key management used for BCSI
encryption in Azure and Azure Government.



How can Microsoft assist registered entities subject to CIP-013-1 Cyber Security -
Supply Chain Risk Management?
NERC CIP-013-1  specifies that “each responsible entity shall develop one or more
documented supply chain cyber security risk management plan(s) for high and medium
impact BES Cyber Systems.” A BES Cyber System is composed of one or more BES Cyber
Assets. If you're planning to deploy a high or medium impact BES Cyber System on
Azure, you will need to demonstrate compliance with CIP-013-1. If you're an Azure or
Azure Government customer, Microsoft can provide you with proper supply chain risk
management assurances for your cloud-based assets:

NIST SP 800-161  is a comprehensive guidance for supply chain risk management
practices. Azure and Azure Government maintain FedRAMP High authorizations to
operate that are based on the NIST SP 800-53  control baseline. The System and
Services Acquisition  (SA) control family that is assessed during a FedRAMP audit
provides detailed coverage for supply chain risk assessment, including the SA-12
control  that is focused specifically on supply chain protection.
The current Azure and Azure Government NIST SP 800-53 implementations of SA-
12 are in alignment with the NIST SP 800-161 recommendations, as assessed
during Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP audits. Microsoft supply chain best
practices are built into the procurement process to prevent and mitigate
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supply chain risks, such as
insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of
malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development
practices in the ICT supply chain. For more information, see Azure NIST SP 800-161
documentation.
Compliance with CIP-013-1 isn't required for BCSI deployment in the cloud.

７ Note

If you're enquiring about supply chain risk assessment for your on-premises
deployed Windows servers and desktops, you should contact your Microsoft
account representative for assistance with Windows supply chain risk management
assurances. While CIP-013-1 inquiries and corresponding questionnaires are
important, they're typically not related to Azure cloud services unless you're
deploying high or medium impact BES Cyber Systems on Azure.

Can Microsoft furnish a Common Criteria certificate that I need to comply with NERC
CIP-013-1 Cyber Security – Supply Chain Risk Management?
Yes, but not for Azure or any other Microsoft cloud service. Your request for Common
Criteria certificate is likely not related to cloud services but is instead focused on your
on-premises desktops and servers that normally run a Windows operating system.



Common Criteria Certification  isn't applicable to cloud services – it is intended to
evaluate security functions in IT software and hardware products, for example, boxed
software products such as Windows desktop or server operating systems. For more
information, see Windows Common Criteria Certifications or contact your Microsoft
account team for assistance with Windows supply chain risk management assurances.

Does Microsoft have a supply chain assurance program?
Yes. For more information about Microsoft supply chain assurances, see Azure NIST SP
800-161 documentation.

What is BES Cyber System Information (BCSI)?
The following definition  is provided by NERC: BCSI is information about the BES Cyber
System that could be used to gain unauthorized access or pose a security threat to the
BES Cyber System. BES Cyber System Information doesn't include individual pieces of
information that by themselves don't pose a threat or couldn't be used to allow
unauthorized access to BES Cyber Systems, such as, but not limited to, device names,
individual IP addresses without context, ESP names, or policy statements. Examples of
BES Cyber System Information may include, but aren't limited to: security procedures or
security information about BES Cyber Systems, Physical Access Control Systems, and
Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems that isn't publicly available and could
be used to allow unauthorized access or unauthorized distribution; collections of
network addresses; and network topology of the BES Cyber System.

Can I store or process BCSI on Azure or Azure Government?
Yes. For more information, see BCSI guidance. If you're a registered entity subject to
NERC CIP compliance obligations, you're ultimately responsible for compliance with
NERC CIP standards according to your own facts and circumstances.

Title 23 NYCRR Part 500
Article • 03/14/2025

Title 23 NYCRR Part 500 overview
In response to the significant and ever-increasing threats to the cybersecurity of
information and financial systems, in 2017, the State of New York Department of
Financial Services imposed a new set of cybersecurity requirements on financial
institutions that are licensed or authorized to do business in the state. Title 23 New York
Codes, Rules, and Regulation Part 500: Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services
Companies is designed to protect customer data and the information technology
systems of financial institutions such as state-chartered, private, and international banks,
mortgage brokers, and insurance companies.

Microsoft and Title 23 NYCRR Part 500
Microsoft provides a comprehensive guide, Microsoft Cloud Services: Supporting
Compliance with NYDFS Cybersecurity Requirements , for financial services regulated
under Title 23 NYCRR Part 500. It explains in depth how Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power
BI cloud services support compliance with the requirements. Financial institutions that
seek to operate in the global financial center of New York must meet them, so
compliance is critical for many institutions.

The New York regulations require each financial institution to:

Develop and maintain a robust cybersecurity program starting with an
assessment of the institution's specific risk profile and then designing a program
that addresses them. See Microsoft Cloud Financial Services  for information on
engaging with Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services. Additionally, the Financial
Services  page of our Service Trust Portal contains country/region specific
resources to help you better understand how to meet your global regulatory
requirements.
Implement a comprehensive cybersecurity policy that addresses information
security, data governance and classification, access controls, business continuity,
and the like. Microsoft offers guidance for developing this policy with in-depth
information about our certifications and risk assessments; business continuity and
disaster recovery metrics; and diagnostics for logging and auditing.
Designate a chief information security officer (CISO) to manage the cybersecurity
program and enforce policy. To help your CISO, Microsoft provides in-depth



cybersecurity information about Microsoft cloud deployments through Microsoft
Defender for Cloud , Microsoft 365 Advanced Threat Analytics, and Power BI
Security .
Monitor and test the effectiveness of its cybersecurity program: Microsoft
provides information from audits of its cybersecurity practices that include
continuous monitoring, periodic penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.
Customers can conduct their own tests without advance permission from
Microsoft.
Maintain an audit trail. Built-in audit functionalities of Azure, Microsoft 365, and
Power BI customers generate information that can be used to reconstruct financial
transactions and develop audit trail information.
Limit access to information systems that contain nonpublic information:
Measures that Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power BI offer a role-based access control
(RBAC) process native to each service, strict security and access requirements for
every Microsoft administrator, and audits of every request for elevated access
privileges.
Institute procedures to assess and test the security of externally developed
applications: For developers using Visual Studio, Security Rules for managed code
can help ensure that application cybersecurity threats are detected and mitigated
before the code is deployed.
Use periodic risk assessments to design and enhance cybersecurity programs:
For customers, Microsoft aggregates information about security threats, provides
roadmaps of change management, and regularly updates information about
subcontractors. Microsoft also regularly conducts risk assessments of its own
services, the results of which are available to customers.
Use qualified personnel to manage cybersecurity risks and oversee cybersecurity
functions: Microsoft employs stringent procedures for our employee access to
your customer data. If we hire subcontractors, we remain responsible for service
delivery, and ensure that subcontractors fully comply with Microsoft privacy and
security commitments, including requirements for handling sensitive data,
background checks, and non-disclosure agreements.
Implement policies and procedures to ensure the security of information held by
third-party service providers: Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power BI make multifactor
authentication available for all inbound connections to company networks;
implement controls, including encryption, to protect nonpublic information in
transit over external networks and at rest; and offer Microsoft Online Services
Terms  that provide for customer notification, incident investigation, and risk
mitigation for security incidents.
Implement data retention and deletion policies and procedures: You can always
access and extract your customer data stored in Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power
BI.



Monitor the activity of authorized users, detect unauthorized access, and offer
regular cybersecurity awareness training to employees: Azure, Microsoft 365, and
Power BI include outside-in monitoring to raise alerts about incidents, and
extensive diagnostics for logging and auditing. Microsoft Virtual Academy  offers
online training that covers the cybersecurity of Microsoft cloud services.
Develop plans to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents: Microsoft
helps you prepare for cybersecurity incidents using a defensive strategy to detect,
predict, and prevent security breaches before they occur. When developing your
own plans, you can draw on our incident management plan for responding to
cybersecurity breaches.

Dutch Authority for the Financial
Markets and the Central Bank of the
Netherlands
Article • 03/14/2025

About the AFM and DNB
The primary financial regulators in the Netherlands are the Dutch Authority for the
Financial Markets  (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, AFM ) and the Central Bank of the
Netherlands  (De Nederlandsche Bank, DNB ). The AFM, whose role is comparable to
the SEC in the United States, is the independent supervisory authority for the savings,
lending, investment, and insurance markets. The DNB, within the European System of
Central Banks, determines, and implements monetary policy and exercises prudential
supervision of financial organizations for the Netherlands.

Both of these institutions act in concert with the European Banking Authority (EBA), 'an
independent EU authority that works to ensure effective and consistent prudential
regulation and supervision across the European banking sector.' To that end, the EBA
has outlined a comprehensive approach to the use of cloud computing by financial
institutions in the EU, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers .

In general, the laws and guidelines support the point of view that cloud computing
involving third-party services qualifies as a form of outsourcing, and financial institutions
in the Netherlands must address the associated risks before moving business activities
to the cloud. These include:

The Financial Supervision Act (FSA) (Dutch ), issued by the Dutch legislature in
2018, attaches conditions for financial institutions to control the risks associated
with outsourcing and ensure that it doesn't impede regulatory supervision.
The Circulaire Cloud Computing, issued by the DNB, requires that before
supervised Dutch institutions engage in cloud computing, they must inform the
DNB of their prospective outsourcing arrangements to ensure that operational
processes and risks are under control.

Using a template that the DNB provides, they must submit a mandatory risk analysis
that includes:

An assessment regarding: compliance with current legislation, mutual
understanding between the parties regarding the services offered, the stability and



reliability of the service provider, where the services are to be provided, and the
importance of and degree of reliance on the outsourced services.
Explicit attention to addressing risks associated with data integrity, confidentiality,
and availability.

The Commission Delegated Regulation EU 2017/565  describes at great length the
requirements for an outsourcing agreement between investment firms and cloud service
providers.

Microsoft and the AFM and DNB
To help guide financial institutions in the Netherlands considering outsourcing business
functions to the cloud, Microsoft has published a compliance checklist for financial
institutions in the Netherlands . By reviewing and completing the checklist, financial
organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence that
they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

When financial institutions in the Netherlands outsource business activities to the cloud,
they must comply with the rules and guidelines of the Dutch Authority for Financial
Markets (AFM) and the Central Bank of the Netherlands (DNB) within the broad policy
framework of the European Banking Authority (EBA).

The Microsoft checklist helps financial firms in the Netherlands conducting due-
diligence assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services against those regulatory
obligations. The checklist can be used as a tool to measure compliance against a
regulatory framework and provide an internal structure for documenting
compliance, and help customers conduct their own risk assessments of Microsoft
business cloud services.

Financial Authority (AMF) and
Prudential Authority (ACPR) France
Article • 03/17/2025

About the AMF and ACPR
The Financial Authority  (Autorité des Marchés Financiers, AMF ) and the Prudential
Authority  (Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, ACPR ) are the primary
financial regulators in France. In its capacity as the stock market regulator, the AMF is
responsible for the supervision of financial markets and investment firms. The ACPR, an
independent administrative authority under the central bank, the Banque de France ,
supervises the banking and insurance sectors.

The AMF and ACPR act in concert with the European Banking Authority (EBA), 'an
independent EU authority, which works to ensure effective and consistent prudential
regulation and supervision across the European banking sector.' To that end, the EBA
has outlined a comprehensive approach to the use of cloud computing by financial
institutions in the EU, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers .

There are several requirements and guidelines that financial institutions in France should
be aware of when moving operational functions to the cloud:

The AMF General Regulation (French  and English ) sets rules and procedures to
enforce financial legislation. In particular, Article 313-75 sets forth conditions that
must be reflected in contracts that financial institutions enter into with cloud
service providers.
ACPR published The risks associated with cloud computing (French  and
English ), which encourages organizations under ACPR supervision to take
suitable measures to manage risk when they outsource business functions to the
cloud. In addition, Article 239 in the ACPR Order of 3 November 2014 on the
internal control of companies  (French) under ACPR supervision also specifies
mandatory terms to be included in contracts with cloud service providers.
In certain cases, regulated institutions must notify the AMF and ACPR regarding
material outsourcing arrangements, particularly if they have the potential to
significantly impact their business operations.
In its role as the data protection authority for France, the CNIL  (Commission
Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) has issued many cloud computing
guidelines, including Recommendations for companies planning to use cloud
computing services (French  and English ).



Microsoft and the AMF and ACPR
To help guide financial institutions in France considering outsourcing business functions
to the cloud, Microsoft has published Navigating your way to the cloud: a checklist for
financial institutions in France . By reviewing and completing the checklist, financial
organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence that
they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

When financial institutions in France outsource business activities to the cloud, they
must comply with the requirements of the Financial Authority (AMF) and Prudential
Authority (ACPR) of France within the broad policy framework of the European Banking
Authority (EBA). In particular, they must be aware of Article 313-75 of the AMF General
Regulation, and the ACPR guidelines on cloud computing risks and its mandatory
requirements for contracts with cloud service providers.

The Microsoft checklist helps French financial firms conducting due-diligence
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services against those regulatory
obligations. The checklist can be used as a tool to measure compliance against a
regulatory framework and provide an internal structure for documenting
compliance, and help customers conduct their own risk assessments of Microsoft
business cloud services.

Frequently asked questions



Is regulatory approval required?

The EBA publication, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers ,
outlines a comprehensive approach to material outsourcing by financial institutions in
the EU. Also, in certain instances, financial firms must notify the AMF or ACPR of their
outsourcing arrangements, as described on pages 8 and 9 of the checklist . While it's
unlikely these circumstances would apply to the use of Microsoft cloud services,
financial services should verify their applicability by reviewing the checklist.

Are there any mandatory terms that must be included in the contract with the cloud
services provider?

Yes. Article 239 of the ACPR Order of 3 November 2014  and Article 313-75 of the AMF
General Regulation  set forth conditions that must be reflected in contracts that
financial institutions enter into with cloud service providers. Part 2 of the Microsoft
checklist  (page 62) maps these against the sections in Microsoft contractual
documents where they're addressed.

Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority (APRA)
Article • 01/31/2024

APRA overview
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  (APRA) oversees banks, credit unions,
insurance companies, and other financial services institutions in Australia. Recognizing
the momentum towards cloud computing, APRA has called on regulated entities to
implement a thoughtful cloud-adoption strategy with effective governance, thorough
risk assessment, and regular assurance processes. Regulated institutions must comply
with the APRA Prudential Standard CPS 231 Outsourcing  when outsourcing a material
business activity—any activity that has the potential, if disrupted, to have a significant
impact on the financial institution's business operations or ability to manage its risks
effectively. Based on its review of outsourcing arrangements involving cloud computing
services submitted to APRA, APRA published specific, detailed guidance in its
information paper, Outsourcing involving cloud computing services  to help regulated
entities assess cloud providers and services more effectively and guide them through
the regulatory issues of outsourcing to the cloud. When outsourcing, including to a
cloud service, regulated institutions must also review and consider their ongoing
compliance with APRA Prudential Standard CPS 234 Information Security .

Microsoft and APRA
For financial institutions in Australia that are assessing cloud providers and their
services, Microsoft has published:

Microsoft response to the APRA Information Paper on Cloud
Microsoft cloud services: a compliance checklist for financial institutions in
Australia
Microsoft cloud services: compliance with APRA Prudential Standard CPS 234

Together they demonstrate how financial firms can move data and workloads to
Microsoft Azure with the confidence that they are complying with Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority (APRA) regulations and guidance.

To learn about the benefits of APRA-compliant financial services on Azure, read the
Regtech meets Fintech: Perpetual and Microsoft transform the finance sector  article.



Microsoft response to the APRA Information
Paper on Cloud
This Microsoft paper provides detailed guidance for financial services with a detailed
response to each issue raised in the APRA Information Paper Outsourcing involving
cloud computing services . The APRA guidelines identify three risk categories into
which cloud usage typically falls—low, heightened, and extreme inherent risk—and
highlight key issues that regulated entities must consider as part of their risk
assessment.

The Microsoft response focuses on the two highest risk categories. While cloud services
are not prohibited by any risk category, APRA expects you to undertake a
commensurately higher level of diligence, and you should expect an increasing level of
APRA scrutiny, as you move up the risk categories. APRA lists a range of factors that
typically indicate high or extreme inherent risk for cloud outsourcing. Microsoft
addresses each of these factors in depth, providing information and tools to help you
assess and manage the risk of moving your data and workloads to Azure.

Microsoft also addresses each APRA risk management consideration: strategy,
governance, solution selection process, APRA access and ability to act, transition
approach, risk assessments and security, ongoing oversight, business disruption, and
audit and assurance. Point by point, we give advice and offer tools to help you respond
to each issue when deploying Azure.

regulations: Download the Microsoft response to the APRA Information Paper on
Cloud .

Microsoft response to the APRA CPS 234 on
Information Security
APRA Prudential Standard CPS 234 Information Security  requires regulated
institutions to:

clearly define information-security related roles and responsibilities;
maintain an information security capability commensurate with the size and extent
of threats to their information assets;
implement controls to protect information assets and undertake regular testing
and assurance of the effectiveness of controls; and
promptly notify APRA of material information security incidents.



CPS 234 closely mirrors the core Microsoft security framework: protect, detect, and
respond.

Microsoft cloud services: compliance with APRA Prudential Standard CPS 234
Information Security  sets out each of the relevant CPS 234 regulatory obligations, and
maps against it the Microsoft cloud service controls, capabilities, functions, contract
commitments, and supporting information to help your APRA-regulated entity comply
with its regulatory obligations under CPS 234.

Navigating your way to the cloud: A
compliance checklist for financial institutions in
Australia
This Microsoft checklist introduces APRA regulatory requirements that financial firms
must address when moving to the cloud. It maps Azure against not only the Prudential
Standard CPS 231 Outsourcing , but other relevant APRA standards, such as for
business continuity and risk management. Completing this checklist helps your financial
service institutions adopt Azure with the confidence that it meets the relevant APRA
requirements.

By relying on our comprehensive approach to risk assurance in the cloud, we are
confident that Australian financial services organizations can move to Microsoft cloud
services in a manner that is not only consistent with APRA guidance, but can provide
customers with a more advanced security risk management profile than on-premises or
other hosted solutions.

Office 365 environments



Microsoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated
experience of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide.
Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their customer
data is located. Microsoft may replicate customer data to other regions within the same
geographic area (for example, the United States) for data resiliency, but Microsoft will
not replicate customer data outside the chosen geographic area.

This section covers the following Office 365 environments:

Client software (Client): commercial client software running on customer devices.
Office 365 (Commercial): the commercial public Office 365 cloud service available
globally.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC): the Office 365 GCC cloud
service is available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments,
and contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud - High (GCC High): the Office 365 GCC
High cloud service is designed according to Department of Defense (DoD) Security
Requirements Guidelines Level 4 controls and supports strictly regulated federal
and defense information. This environment is used by federal agencies, the
Defense Industrial Base (DIBs), and government contractors.
Office 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to
DoD Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal

Frequently asked questions
Do financial institutions need APRA approval before outsourcing material business
activities?

No. However, most regulated financial organizations must notify APRA after entering
into agreements to outsource material business activities within Australia or consult with
APRA before outsourcing those activities outside of Australia.

In addition, if the cloud services are deemed to carry 'heightened or extreme inherent
risk' as described in the APRA Information Paper on Clouds , the financial institution is
encouraged (but not required) to consult with APRA, regardless of whether the service is
provided within or outside of Australia.

Are transfers of data outside of Australia permitted?

Yes. General privacy legislation (which applies across all sectors, not just to financial
institutions) permits transfers outside of Australia under certain conditions. Microsoft
agrees to contractual terms in line with Australian Privacy Principles so that transfers of
data outside of Australia are permitted when you use Microsoft cloud services. However,
many of our Australian financial services customers take advantage of the cloud services
available from our Australian datacenters, for which we make specific contractual
commitments to store categories of data at rest in the Australian geography. These
commitments are outlined further in the compliance checklist .

European Banking Authority (EBA)
06/18/2025

About the EBA
The European Banking Authority  (EBA) is 'an independent authority that works to ensure
effective and consistent prudential regulation and supervision across the EU banking sector'. In
December 2017, the EBA issued its Final Report: Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud
services providers , which outlined a comprehensive approach to the outsourcing of cloud
computing by financial institutions in the EU. The recommendations clarify when outsourcing
to the cloud is permitted, apply a principles-based approach towards measuring risk from a
technology-neutral perspective, and strive towards greater harmonization within Europe and
beyond.

The EBA recommendations took effect in July 2018, and they build on and add clarity to the
general outsourcing guidelines published in 2006 by the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors. In fact, the issuance of these recommendations comes after a consultation period
during which Microsoft provided substantive feedback. Many of the final recommendations
account for comments Microsoft provided to the EBA.

Microsoft and the EBA
To help financial institutions in the EU follow the European Banking Authority (EBA)
recommendations for cloud adoption, Microsoft published Checklist for Financial Institutions in
Europe . This document addresses key requirements and explains how Microsoft Azure and
Microsoft 365 can be used to satisfy them. The guidance can help financial institutions adopt
Azure and Microsoft 365 with the confidence that they can meet their obligations under the
EBA framework.

The Microsoft guidance addresses, point by point, each of the EBA recommendations:

Audit rights. Microsoft provides contractual audit rights for customers and rights of
examination for regulators in its industry-leading Financial Services Amendment. If you
require the Financial Services Amendment, please reach out to your account
representative.
Notification regarding outsourcing. Microsoft can assist customers with notifying
regulators of material activities to be outsourced.
Data residency. With 36 regions, including six in Europe, Microsoft offers the largest
number of datacenters worldwide of any cloud service provider. Organizations can deploy
workloads in one region without being required to host data in Europe.



Notification regarding subcontractors. Microsoft leads the industry with a contractual
commitment to provide customers with 180-day notice of new subcontractors, and a
right to terminate if the customer doesn't approve of the appointment of a new
subcontractor.
Business continuity. Microsoft provides business continuity and resolution provisions in
our Financial Services Amendment, including the willingness to provide transition
assistance through Microsoft Consulting Services.
Risk assessment and security monitoring. Microsoft enables customers to conduct their
own risk assessments and provides tools and dashboards so they can supervise and
monitor our cloud services.

FCA and PRA (UK)
Article • 04/05/2023

FCA and PRA overview
The Prudential Regulation Authority  (PRA) is responsible for the prudential supervision
of around 1,500 financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies, building
societies, credit unions, and certain large investment firms. As a prudential regulator, the
PRA has a general objective to promote the financial soundness of the firms it regulates.

The Financial Conduct Authority  (FCA) has responsibility for business supervision of all
financial services firms, which includes nearly 60,000 businesses. The FCA has prudential
supervision for 49,000 firms and is also responsible for supervising outsourcing
arrangements established by firms not supervised by the PRA.

In July 2016, the FCA published the FG 16/5 Guidance for firms outsourcing to the cloud
and other third-party IT services  intended to help firms authorized under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000  (FSMA) oversee all aspects of their outsourcing
arrangements. This guidance was subsequently updated to take account of more recent
regulatory developments, such as the implementation of the European Banking
Authority (EBA) Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements  (EBA/GL/2019/02) which was
enacted in September 2019. The current version of the FCA guidance was published in
September 2019 following this development.

In December 2019, the PRA published a consultation paper CP30/19 Outsourcing and
third-party risk management , which takes into account both the EBA Guidelines on
outsourcing arrangements and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority (EIOPA) Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers . In March
2021, the PRA published a policy statement PS7/21 Outsourcing and third-party risk
management  that provides feedback to CP30/19 responses and contains the PRA's
final Supervisory Statement SS2/21 Outsourcing and third-party risk management .

７ Note

Supervisory Statement SS2/21 sets out the PRA's expectations of how PRA-
regulated firms should comply with regulatory requirements and expectations
relating to outsourcing and third-party risk management. Firms are expected to
comply with the expectations in SS2/21 by 31 March 2022.



For more information, see the PRA's Outsourcing and third-party risk management
documentation.

There are additional requirements and guidelines that financial institutions in the United
Kingdom should be aware of when moving to the cloud, including the FSMA, Senior
Management Arrangements, Systems, and Controls Sourcebook  (SYSC) in the FCA
Handbook, the European Banking Authority (EBA) Final Report on Recommendations on
Outsourcing to Cloud Service Providers EBA/REC/2017/03, and others.

To assist UK financial services firms regulated by the FCA and PRA with cloud adoption,
Microsoft has published several documents described in Guidance documents.

Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC)
Article • 03/14/2025

FFIEC overview
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is a formal interagency
body comprising five banking regulators that are responsible for US federal government
examinations of financial institutions in the United States. The FFIEC Examiner Education
Office publishes IT Examination Handbooks intended for field examiners from FFIEC
member agencies.

The FFIEC Audit IT Examination Handbook  contains guidance for these examiners to
assess the quality and effectiveness of IT audit programs of both financial institutions
and TSPs. Specifically, it includes mention of SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 attestation
reports of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as examples of
independent audit reports. However, the FFIEC recommends that financial institutions
not rely solely on the information contained in these reports, but also use verification
and monitoring procedures discussed in detail in the FFIEC Outsourcing Technology
Services IT Examination Handbook .

Microsoft and FFIEC
Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Power BI, and Microsoft Office 365 are built to meet the
stringent requirements of providing cloud services for financial services institutions.
Azure provides financial institutions with SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2, and SOC 3
attestation reports produced by an independent auditing firm to help customers meet
their own FFIEC compliance obligations. For example, the SOC 1 Type 2 attestation is
performed under:

SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes
AT-C section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service
Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(AICPA, Professional Standards).
SOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant
to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).

The AICPA SSAE 18 standard replaced SAS 70, and it's appropriate for reporting on
controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial



reporting. This is the formal audit that financial institutions can leverage for third-party
reviews of technology service providers when pursuing their own FFIEC specific
compliance obligations for assets deployed on Azure. It includes auditor’s opinion on
control effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified
monitoring period.

Moreover, Azure has developed an Excel-based cloud security diagnostic tool intended
to expedite a risk assessment that a financial institution may want to conduct relative to
Azure services. The tool is based on a spreadsheet featuring 19 separate domains that
identify requirements set forth in relevant standards and financial services-related
regulations, including the FFIEC IT Examination Handbooks. The risk assessment tool is
prepopulated with explanations for how Azure complies with requirements applicable to
cloud service providers, and can assist customers in meeting their own FFIEC compliance
requirements.

Financial Market Supervisory Authority
(FINMA) Switzerland
Article • 03/14/2025

About FINMA
The Financial Market Supervisory Authority  (Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht ,
FINMA) is the regulator of independent financial markets in Switzerland and is
responsible for ensuring that Swiss financial markets function effectively. It has
prudential supervision over banks, insurance companies, exchanges, securities dealers,
and other financial institutions.

The FINMA published Circular 2023/1 Operational risks and resilience  to define the
requirements that banks, securities dealers, and insurance companies must abide by
when they outsource to a service provider any functions that are significant to the
company's business activities. Any company that outsources its business activities is
accountable to the FINMA just as it would be if it carried out the outsourced functions
itself.

Microsoft and FINMA
To help guide financial institutions in Switzerland considering outsourcing business
functions to the cloud, Microsoft has published A compliance checklist for financial
institutions in Switzerland . By reviewing and completing the checklist, financial
organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence that
they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

When Swiss financial institutions outsource business activities, they must comply with
the requirements of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and be
cognizant of other requirements and guidelines that include those of the Swiss Bank Act,
the Swiss Bank Ordinance, and the Swiss Insurance Supervision Act.

The Microsoft checklist helps Swiss financial firms conducting due-diligence
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services against those regulatory
obligations. The checklist can be used as a tool to measure compliance against a



regulatory framework and provide an internal structure for documenting
compliance, and help customers conduct their own risk assessments of Microsoft
business cloud services.

Frequently asked questions
Is regulatory approval required?

No. The use of public cloud computing is permitted without an approval by the FINMA,
subject always to compliance with the requirements set out in the regulations and
guidelines listed above.

Are there any mandatory terms that must be included in the contract with the cloud
services provider?

Yes. In Part 2 of the Compliance Checklist, we have mapped these terms against the
sections in the Microsoft contractual documents where you find them addressed. In

Center for Financial Industry
Information Systems (FISC)
Article • 01/31/2024

FISC overview
The Center for Financial Industry Information Systems (FISC) is a not-for-profit
organization established by the Japanese Ministry of Finance in 1984 to promote
security in banking computer systems in Japan. Some 700 corporations in Japan are
supporting members, including major financial institutions, insurance and credit
companies, securities firms, computer manufacturers, and telecommunications
enterprises.

In collaboration with its member institutions, the Bank of Japan, and the Financial
Services Agency (a government organization responsible for overseeing banking,
securities and exchange, and insurance in Japan), the FISC created guidelines for the
security of banking information systems. These include basic auditing standards for
computer system controls, contingency planning in the event of a disaster, and the
development of security policies and standards encompassed in more than 300 controls.

Although the application of these guidelines in a cloud computing environment is not
required by regulation, most financial institutions in Japan that implement cloud services
have built information systems that satisfy these security standards, and it can be
difficult to justify diverging from them. (The latest guidelines, Version 8 Supplemental
Revised, issued in 2015, added two revisions relating to the use of cloud services by
financial institutions and countermeasures against cyberattack.)

Conformance with this framework is not required by regulation, and not audited or
otherwise validated by the FISC.

Microsoft and FISC
Microsoft engaged outside assessors to validate that Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365,
and Microsoft Office 365 meet requirements of the FISC Security Guidelines on
Computer Systems for Financial Institutions 9th Edition Revised. Microsoft provided
evidence of compliance in each of the following areas:

Datacenter guidelines for buildings and computer rooms, power, air conditioning,
datacenter, and facilities monitoring.



Operational guidelines for organizations, training, access control, system
development, and auditing.
Technical guidelines for measures to improve the reliability of hardware and
software, and for countermeasures against security risks including data protection,
prevention against unauthorized use, threat detection, and disaster recovery.

Financial institutions can rely on this evaluation of the compliance of these three areas
for the in-scope infrastructure and platform services of Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365,
and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)
Denmark
Article • 09/15/2023

About the FSA
The Financial Supervisory Authority  (Finanstilsynet ), under the Ministry of Industry,
Business, and Financial Affairs, is the financial regulatory authority of the Danish
government. Its principal role is to prepare regulatory guidelines for financial institutions
in Denmark and monitor their compliance, as well as cooperate with regional and
international authorities and regulators.

The FSA acts in concert with the European Banking Authority (EBA), 'an independent EU
authority, which works to ensure effective and consistent prudential regulation and
supervision across the European banking sector.' To that end, the EBA has outlined a
comprehensive approach to the use of cloud computing by financial institutions in the
EU, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers .

There are several guidelines that financial institutions in Denmark should be aware of
when moving business functions to the cloud. In general, they prescribe contractual
requirements for both financial institutions and cloud service providers to help ensure
that financial organizations can adequately monitor and audit the outsourced functions.
These include guidelines issued by the Ministry of Industry, Business, and Financial
Affairs:

The Danish Act on Financial Institutions (Danish )
The Executive Order 1304 on outsourcing of significant areas of activity (Danish
and English ) and the accompanying Guideline (Danish)
Guidance on the use of cloud services as part of IT–outsourcing (Danish ) issued
by the FSA.

Microsoft and the FSA
To help guide financial institutions in Denmark considering outsourcing business
functions to the cloud, Microsoft has published a compliance checklist for financial
institutions in Denmark . By reviewing and completing the checklist, financial
organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence that
they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.



When Danish financial institutions outsource business activities they must comply with
the requirements of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), and work within the broad
policy framework of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Specifically, those
requirements focus on how contractual agreements between financial services and
cloud providers can ensure adequate control of outsourced activities.

The Microsoft checklist helps Danish financial firms conducting due-diligence
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services against those regulatory
obligations. The checklist can be used as a tool to measure compliance against a
regulatory framework and provide an internal structure for documenting
compliance, and help customers conduct their own risk assessments of Microsoft
business cloud services.

How to implement
Compliance checklist: Denmark : Financial firms can get help in conducting risk
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services.
Financial use cases: Use case overviews, tutorials, and other resources to build

Frequently asked questions
Is regulatory approval required?

No. The FSA doesn't approve outsourcing and the outsourcer (or cloud service provider)
is, therefore, not required to obtain advance approval from the FSA. However, the FSA
does specify that the outsourcer must notify it no later than eight business days after
entering into an outsourcing agreement. The notification must be made in writing using
a form specified by the FSA.



Are there any mandatory terms that must be included in the contract with the cloud
services provider?

Yes. The Executive Order on Outsourcing of Significant Areas of Activity (and the
accompanying Guideline) stipulates some specific points that financial institutions must
incorporate in their cloud services contracts. Part 2 of the Microsoft checklist  (page
48) maps these points against the sections in the Microsoft contractual documents
where they're addressed.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
Article • 01/31/2024

GLBA overview
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a US law that reformed the financial services
industry, allowing commercial and investment banks, securities firms, and insurance
companies to consolidate, and addressed concerns about protecting consumer privacy.
It required the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other financial services regulators to
implement regulations to address such privacy provisions as the Financial Privacy Rule
and the Safeguards Rule. GLBA requirements to safeguard sensitive consumer data
apply to financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers,
such as loans, investment advice, and insurance. The FTC is charged with enforcing
compliance.

Microsoft and GLBA
Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Power BI can help
meet the stringent requirements of providing cloud services for financial services
institutions. As part of our support, we offer guidance to help you comply with the
requirements of the GLBA by providing technical and organizational safeguards to help
maintain security and prevent unauthorized usage.

Microsoft has developed risk assessment tools for both Azure  and Office 365  to
help you more efficiently conduct a risk assessment of Azure and Office 365 services.
The tool (an Excel spreadsheet) features numerous information security domains (such
as security policy and risk management) that track the requirements of financial services
regulations and other relevant standards, including GLBA (in Column R in the Azure
spreadsheet and Column Q in the Office 365 spreadsheet). The tools explain how Azure
and Office 365 comply with each requirement applicable to cloud service providers and
can help you meet GLBA security requirements.

Financial Supervision Authority (KNF)
Poland
Article • 09/15/2023

About the KNF
The Polish Financial Supervision Authority  (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego , KNF) is
the financial regulatory authority in Poland, responsible for supervision of the financial
market, which includes oversight over banking, capital markets, insurance, pension
schemes, and electronic money institutions.

The KNF acts in concert with the European Banking Authority  (EBA), 'an independent
EU authority, which works to ensure effective and consistent prudential regulation and
supervision across the European banking sector.' To that end, the EBA has outlined a
comprehensive approach to the use of cloud computing by financial institutions in the
EU, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers .

There are several requirements and guidelines that financial institutions in Poland
should be aware of when moving business functions and data to the cloud:

The Banking Act of 1997 doesn't regulate cloud services directly but instead sets
out legal requirements for outsourcing banking operations including how personal
information can be processed. Cloud services could be subject to Banking Act
provisions if the outsourced services are of key significance for the bank, or if
outsourcing involves giving the service provider access to sensitive data that is
subject to banking secrecy requirements.
The Announcement, issued by the KNF Office in 2017, provides a detailed checklist
and action plan for regulated institutions that intend to move business functions to
the cloud.
Recommendation D : Management of Information Technology and ICT
Environment Security at Banks defines KNF expectations for prudent IT security
management by banks, particularly as to how they manage risk. The KNF makes 22
recommendations for best security practices and has issued comparable guidelines
for insurance companies , investment firms , and general pension companies .

In addition, the use of cloud services by financial institutions must comply with Poland's
Personal Data Protection Act of 1997, which is fundamental to the processing of
personal data. To align with the GDPR, it was amended in late 2018 by the Act on
Facilitation of Performance of Business Activity and took effect on 1 January 2019.



Microsoft and the KNF
To help guide financial institutions in Poland considering outsourcing business functions
to the cloud, Microsoft has published Navigating your way to the cloud: A compliance
checklist for financial institutions in Poland . By reviewing and completing the checklist,
financial organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence
that they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

When financial institutions in Poland outsource business activities to the cloud, they
must address requirements of the Banking Act of 1997 and the 2017 KNF
Announcement regarding the use of data processing services in the cloud, both of
which fall within the broad policy framework of the European Banking Authority. In
addition, financial firms using cloud services must comply with the GDPR-aligned 2018
amendment to the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997, now updated to align with the
GDPR.

The Microsoft checklist helps Polish financial firms conducting due-diligence
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services against those regulatory
obligations. The checklist can be used as a tool to measure compliance against a

compliance, and help customers conduct their own risk assessments of Microsoft
business cloud services.

Frequently asked questions
Is regulatory approval required?

No. However, under the Banking Act of 1997, if the service provider is based outside the
European Economic Area (EEA) or if outsourced operations are to be implemented
outside the EEA, banks must obtain KNF approval before entering into contracts.

Are there any mandatory terms that must be included in the contract with the cloud
services provider?

Yes. Part 2 of the Microsoft checklist  (page 77) contains a comprehensive list of the
requirements that should be included in contracts with cloud service providers.

Comprehensive Assessment
Article • 11/05/2024

About KY3P Assessments
S&P Global KY3P  Comprehensive Assessment (formerly known as the
TruSight comprehensive assessment), supports regulatory compliance by facilitating
efficient processes through the seamless exchange of standardized and fully validated
risk data between service providers (such as Microsoft) and their clients. The globally
recognized KY3P assessment methodology empowers business with enhanced visibility
into their supply chain risks, allowing them to prioritize customer-centric operations.

７ Note

In January 2023, TruSight was acquired by S&P Global to expand the breadth and
depth of its third-party risk management solutions. TruSight was integrated into
S&P Global KY3P and sits within the S&P Global Market Intelligence division. This
acquisition allows the combination of TruSight's existing compliance and risk
assessment expertise with an established risk management portfolio. For more
information, see S&P Global enhances KY3P® risk management capabilities with
acquisition of TruSight Solutions LLC .

Microsoft and KY3P Assessments (formerly
TruSight)
KY3P Assessments originated as TruSight Solutions, an innovative industry utility built by
a consortium of leading financial services companies. The KY3P Assessments best
practices questionnaire includes over 200 controls across 26 diversified control
categories across nine Risk Domains. KY3P Assessments has assessed Microsoft Cloud
with this methodology annually since 2018.

A rigorous and comprehensive assessment of Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365,
and Microsoft Power Platform, and Microsoft 365 was conducted to validate the design
and implementation of controls according to BPQ requirements. The comprehensive
validation procedures included structured inquiries, policy and procedure inspections,
reviews with supporting evidence, and onsite dynamic control observations.



In September 2018, the first risk assessment of Microsoft cloud services was issued,
Comprehensive Assessment of Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft now undergoes annual reviews
to ensure that the assessment remains current and reflects new regulatory requirements
and technology updates in Microsoft services. The latest report was issued in March
2024.

As a result of this rigorous evaluation, financial services customers now have access on
demand to a high-quality assessment of Microsoft cloud services based on
standardized, industry-backed methodology without having to expend the considerable
resources they would need to conduct it themselves.

Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
and Association of Banks in Singapore
(ABS)
Article • 01/31/2024

MAS and ABS Overview

Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the sole bank regulator in Singapore and
its central bank, issued its Technology Risk Management Guidelines . In the guidelines,
the MAS set out its expectations for outsourcing cloud services by financial institutions
in Singapore, including banks, insurance companies, and trust companies. This was the
result of an industry-wide consultation that began in October 2014 that included
Microsoft participation.

The MAS Guidelines substantially streamline the process for technology adoption,
provide clarity on the regulator's expectations, and address many of the misconceptions
that had previously slowed the financial industry's adoption of cloud solutions.

Furthermore, the guidelines are unequivocal in their support of the use of cloud services
—including a public cloud—by financial institutions and that they stand to benefit from
doing so. They've eliminated the expectation that financial institutions would notify the
MAS before any significant material outsourcing commitments. Instead, MAS-regulated
institutions are expected to refine their risk-based approach when assessing material
outsourcing and conduct a self-assessment of all outsourcing arrangements against
these guidelines. (For now, these guidelines aren't legally binding, but the MAS has
indicated that it will issue a statutory notice in the future.)

Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS)
Shortly after the release of the MAS Guidelines on Outsourcing Risk Management, the
ABS, a non-profit organization representing the interests of local and foreign banks
operating in Singapore (but not other financial institutions), introduced a non-binding
practical guide, Cloud Computing Implementation Guide . It's designed to help banks
implement outsourcing arrangements following MAS Guidelines.



Microsoft MAS and ABS
With the endorsement of cloud computing—including the use of public clouds—by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and support from the Association of Banks in
Singapore (ABS), Microsoft published the Microsoft response to MAS outsourcing
guidelines and ABS guidance  and a Compliance Checklist for financial institutions in
Singapore . Together they demonstrate how financial firms can move data and
workloads to the Microsoft Cloud with the confidence that they're complying with MAS
guidelines and complete a self-assessment of their outsourcing arrangements against
the new guidelines.

The Microsoft response to MAS guidelines and ABS guidance gives financial firms an
overview of the key issues raised by the MAS Guidelines and the ABS Guide as they
apply to cloud services, Microsoft interpretations of and responses to each of the key
issues, and details on how Microsoft can help facilitate compliance with MAS guidelines.
It addresses MAS and ABS guidance separately.

The Microsoft response to the MAS Guidelines focuses on MAS recommendations for
prudent risk management practices for outsourcing. It describes point by point how
Microsoft has the right policies, processes, and tools to help you evaluate the risks,
provides checklists to help you assess our business cloud services, and describes the
processes for governance and internal controls.

The Microsoft response to the ABS Guide centers on Sections 3 and 4.

Section 3 builds on the due diligence and vendor management requirements of
the MAS Guidelines by addressing in more detail such matters as contractual
considerations. We give detailed information about Microsoft vendor management
tools and the assistance we can offer during the due-diligence assessment.
Section 4 recommends a set of key baseline controls—from encryption to
penetration and vulnerability management—that cloud service providers should
have in place when working with banks. We describe how our controls address the
security concerns of each of the specified controls.

Compliance Checklist for Financial Institutions in Singapore



This document includes an overview of the regulatory landscape, which introduces the
relevant requirements in Singapore, and a compliance checklist, which lists the
regulatory issues that need to be addressed and maps Microsoft's cloud services against
those issues. By reviewing and completing the checklist point by point, financial
institutions can adopt Microsoft cloud services with confidence that they're complying
with the relevant requirements in Singapore.

By relying on our comprehensive approach to risk assurance in the cloud, we're
confident that financial institutions in Singapore can move to the Microsoft Cloud in a
manner that is consistent with MAS Guidelines and the ABS Guide, while also providing
a more advanced security risk management profile than many on-premises solutions.

Frequently asked questions
Is regulatory approval required?

No, there's no requirement for prior notification, consultation, or approval of
outsourcing arrangements. However, the MAS expects financial institutions to be ready
to demonstrate how they comply, and to notify the MAS as soon as possible of adverse
developments arising from a financial institution's outsourcing arrangements—for
example, a data breach incident.

What is a 'material' outsourcing arrangement and why is the definition important?

An outsourcing arrangement is 'material' if a service failure or breach has the potential
to materially affect a financial firm's business operations or ability to manage risk and
comply with applicable laws and regulations; or if it involves customer information and,
in the event of any unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, or theft of customer



information, has a material impact on a firm's customers. The definition of 'customer
information' expressly excludes securely encrypted information.

This definition is important since certain provisions of MAS Outsourcing Guidelines
apply only to 'material outsourcing arrangements.' These include an obligation to
perform annual reviews, mandatory contractual clauses addressing audit rights, and
ensuring that outsourcing outside of Singapore doesn't affect MAS supervisory efforts.

National Bank of Belgium (NBB) and the
Financial Services and Markets
Authority (FSMA)
Article • 03/17/2025

About the NBB and FSMA
The primary financial services regulators in Belgium are the National Bank of Belgium
(NBB) and the Financial Services and Markets Authority  (FSMA).

The NBB is responsible for prudential supervision of credit institutions, insurers,
stockbrokers, and other financial organizations. As the central bank of Belgium, the NBB
conducts monetary policy for Belgium and contributes to the stability of its financial
system. Alongside the NBB, the FSMA supervises Belgian financial markets, financial
service providers including investment firms, and supplemental pensions. Its tasks
include oversight of the financial information that companies disseminate and the
products they offer to consumers and their compliance with the rules of business
conduct.

The NBB and FSMA act in concert with the European Banking Authority (EBA), 'an
independent EU authority that works to ensure effective and consistent prudential
regulation and supervision across the European banking sector.' To that end, the EBA
has outlined a comprehensive approach to the use of cloud computing by financial
institutions in the EU, Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers .

There are several requirements and guidelines that financial institutions in Belgium
should be aware of when moving business functions to the cloud, including:

NBB Circular PPB 2004/5, Sound management practices in outsourcing by credit
institutions and investment firms (Dutch  and French ), and the broadly
equivalent provisions of the FSMA Circular 05-06.2007  (French and Dutch) on
organizational requirements for firms providing investment services.
Circular NBB 2009-17, Financial services via the Internet: Prudential requirements
(English ), examines outsourcing risks and sets out the requirements for internal
control and management of those risks. It also discusses compliance with the
financial rules of conduct and the potential impact of cross-border transactions in
the cloud.
Circular NBB 2015-32, Additional prudential expectations regarding operational
business continuity, and security of systemically important financial institutions



(Dutch  and English ), sets out management and security processes for
institutions that play a critical role in the financial system, and whose disruption
could jeopardize its proper functioning.

Office of the Superintendent of
Financial Institutions (OSFI) Canada
Article • 03/17/2025

About the OSFI
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions  (OSFI) is an independent
agency of the Government of Canada responsible for the prudential regulation and
supervision of federally regulated financial institutions and pension plans in Canada.

In its oversight role, OSFI published the B-10 Guidelines for Outsourcing of Business
Activities, Functions, and Processes . They established 'prudent practices, procedures,
or standards' for federally regulated financial institutions to evaluate and manage the
risk associated with outsourcing their business to a service provider.

In addition, the use of cloud services by financial institutions must comply with the
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act  (PIPEDA), and in some
instances, provincial data privacy laws.

Microsoft and OSFI
To help guide financial institutions in Canada considering outsourcing business
functions to the cloud, Microsoft has published Navigating your way to the cloud: A
compliance checklist for financial institutions in Canada . By reviewing and completing
the checklist, financial organizations can adopt Microsoft business cloud services with
the confidence that they're complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

When Canadian financial institutions outsource business activities, they must comply
with the B-10 Guidelines for Outsourcing of Business Activities, Functions, and
Processes  published by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
(OSFI), as well as Canadian privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection
and Electronic Documents Act  (PIPEDA).

Frequently asked questions
Is regulatory approval required?

No. There's no requirement for prior notification, consultation, or approval. The use of
public cloud computing is permitted, subject always to compliance with OSFI
requirements.

The OSFI B-10 Guidelines  indicate that OSFI expects a financial institution to design a
risk management program that applies to all of its outsourcing arrangements, with risk
mitigation commensurate with the associated risks. However, only material outsourcing
arrangements need to be documented by a written contract that addresses safeguards
identified in the guidelines. Part 2 of the Microsoft checklist  (page 53) maps these
against the sections in Microsoft contractual documents where they're addressed.

Are there any mandatory terms that must be included in the contract with the cloud
services provider?

OSPAR (Singapore)
Article • 04/05/2023

OSPAR overview
The Association of Banks in Singapore  (ABS) has issued the ABS Guidelines on Control
Objectives and Procedures for Outsourced Service Providers  (ABS Guidelines). The
ABS Guidelines contain information security guidance for service providers who deliver
services to financial institutions operating in Singapore. The guidelines specify the
baseline organizational controls that service providers must implement in cloud
outsourcing arrangements, particularly for workloads with material impact. The
Outsourced Service Provider's Audit Report  (OSPAR) is the framework that external
auditors use to validate the service provider's controls against the criteria specified in
the ABS Guidelines.

An independent third-party auditor approved by ABS performed a rigorous audit of the
security capabilities of Azure, Dynamics 365, and other Microsoft online services to
assess their compliance with the ABS Guidelines. The auditor attested that Microsoft
cloud services security controls were suitably designed to meet the applicable ABS
controls criteria and that these controls operated effectively during the year-long testing
period.

Achieving the ABS OSPAR attestation demonstrates that the security controls for
Microsoft in-scope services meet the ABS Guidelines, putting these services on the
official list of OSPAR audited outsourced service providers that can be downloaded from
the ABS outsourcing landing page . OSPAR attestation for Azure, Dynamics 365, and
other Microsoft online services provides assurance to financial services customers with
facilities in Singapore that Microsoft meets the high ABS requirements for deploying
compliant financial services solutions.

OSPAR report from the Service Trust Portal (STP) Resources for Singapore  section. For
instructions on how to access audit reports, see Audit documentation. Extra guidance
documentation for Singapore financial institutions is available from the same STP
location.

Frequently asked questions
What is a material outsourcing arrangement and why is the definition important?
An outsourcing arrangement is material if a service failure or breach:

Has the potential to materially affect a financial firm's business operations or ability
to manage risk and comply with applicable laws and regulations; or
If it involves customer information, and any unauthorized access or disclosure, loss,
or theft of customer information, has a material impact on a firm's customers. The
definition of customer information expressly excludes securely encrypted
information.

This definition is important because certain provisions of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Outsourcing Guidelines apply only to 'material outsourcing
arrangements'. These provisions include an obligation to perform annual reviews,
mandatory contractual clauses addressing audit rights, and ensuring that outsourcing
outside of Singapore doesn't affect MAS supervisory efforts.

PCI 3DS
Article • 04/05/2023

PCI 3DS overview
Europay, Mastercard, and Visa (EMV) three-domain secure (3-D Secure  or 3DS) is an
EMVCo messaging protocol that enables cardholders to authenticate with their card
issuers when making card-not-present (CNP) online transactions. The specification aims
at securing authentication and identity verification in mobile and browser-based
applications. The additional security layer helps prevent unauthorized CNP transactions
and protects the merchant from exposure to CNP fraud.

The three domains in the EMVCo specification include:

Acquirer domain: 3DS transactions are initiated from the acquirer domain. The
components under this domain are the 3DS Server (3DSS), requester environment,
integrator, and acquirer.
Interoperability domain: Facilitates the transfer of transaction information
between the acquirer domain and issuer domain. The components under this
domain are the 3DS Directory Server (DS), Directory Server Certificate Authority
(DS-CA), and authorization system.
Issuer domain: 3DS transactions are authenticated in the issuer domain. The
components under this domain are the 3DS Access Control Server (ACS),
cardholder, consumer device, and issuer.

The three critical EMV 3DS components or functions across these domains include:

3DS Server (3DSS)
3DS Directory Server (DS)
3DS Access Control Server (ACS)

The PCI 3DS Core Security Standard  provides a framework for these critical EMV 3DS
functions to implement security controls that support the integrity and confidentiality of
3DS transactions. The standard applies to entities that perform or provide these
functions (3DSS, DS, and ACS), as defined in the EMVCo 3DS Core Specification . Third-
party service providers that can impact these 3DS functions, or the security of the
environments where these functions are performed, may also be required to meet PCI
3DS requirements. Whether an entity is required to validate compliance with the PCI
3DS Core Security Standard is defined by the individual payment brand compliance
programs.



Azure and PCI 3DS
Microsoft retained a qualified 3DS assessor company to conduct an assessment of the
PCI 3-D Secure Environment (3DE) hosted on Azure in accordance with the PCI 3DS Core
Security Standard. The 3DS assessor determined that Azure PCI 3DS service provider
environment meets applicable PCI 3DS controls and issued an Attestation of Compliance
(AoC) for the Azure PCI 3DS environment.

You can download the following attestation documents as part of the Azure PCI 3DS
package (zipped archive) from the Service Trust Portal (STP) PCI DSS reports  section:

Azure PCI 3DS Attestation of Compliance (AoC) provides evidence that Azure
complies with the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard based on a PCI 3DS assessment
conducted by a qualified 3DS assessor.

Azure PCI 3DS Shared Responsibility Matrix supports you with implementing and
documenting security controls for a system built on Azure.

Understanding the shared responsibility for implementing security controls in a
cloud environment is essential when you are building systems and using
services in Azure. Implementing a specific security control may be the
responsibility of Azure, your responsibility, or a shared responsibility between
you and Azure. Different cloud service models affect the way that
responsibilities are shared between you and Azure.
Azure doesn't directly perform the functions of a 3DS Server (3DSS), 3DS
Directory Server (DS), or 3DS Access Control Server (ACS). You have the ability to
host your own 3DS environment on Azure using services offered. The Azure PCI
3DS shared responsibility matrix describes the Azure 3DS assessment scope and
illustrates the PCI 3DS compliance responsibilities for you and Azure. It is
intended to be used by you and your compliance advisors to understand the
scope of the Azure PCI 3DS assessment and expectations for responsibilities
when using Azure services as part of your 3DS environments (3DE). It is your
responsibility to assess and understand your full scope of responsibility for
implementing security controls and ensuring security controls are implemented
in accordance with your compliance obligations.
Azure best practices and recommendations should be taken into consideration.

Azure PCI 3DS whitepaper provides you with guidance on the PCI 3DS Core
Security Standard and how the Azure 3DE can be utilized to implement your 3DE
on Azure. The whitepaper addresses the following key areas:

Provides an overview of the 3DS domains
Examines the relationship between the PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) and
3DS Core Security Standard



Defines the responsibilities shared by Azure and you to meet the 3DS Core
Security Standard requirements

If you're a 3DS entity, you can choose to outsource the hosting and management
of your hardware security module (HSM) infrastructure to a third-party service
provider if the applicable requirements are met. If you're performing 3DS functions
and use the Azure environment for hosting your 3DE, you're still subject to the PCI
3DS Core Security Standard, and must have your environment assessed for all
applicable requirements.

Applicability
Azure

Services in scope
Azure services that you can use to support your 3DE are listed in the Azure PCI 3DS
Attestation of Compliance (AoC).

Audit reports
You can access Azure PCI 3DS audit documents from the Service Trust Portal (STP) PCI
DSS reports  section. For instructions on how to access audit reports, see Audit
documentation. The following documents are included with the Azure PCI 3DS package
(zipped archive):

Frequently asked questions
Why does the Attestation of Compliance (AoC) cover page say "December 2017"?
The December 2017 date on the cover page is when the AoC template was published.
Refer to Section 3 with signatures for the date of the assessment.

How long is the PCI 3DS AoC valid?
The effective period for compliance begins upon passing the audit and receiving the
AoC from the 3DS assessor and ends one year from the date the AoC is signed.



How can I get the Azure PCI 3DS audit documentation?
For links to audit documentation, see Audit reports.

What Azure regions and services are in scope for the assessment?
Refer to "Locations" and "Description of Environment" in Section 2 for a list of Azure
regions and services in scope for the PCI 3DS assessment.

Who has to comply with the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard?
The standard is intended for companies that manage or provide 3DS functions,
specifically: 3DSS, DS, and ACS. It provides guidelines for identifying and implementing
appropriate security controls to protect the 3DS transaction process.

What is the relationship between the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard and PCI DSS?
The PCI 3DS Core Security Standard and PCI DSS are separate standards, each intended
for specific types of entities. The PCI 3DS Core Security Standard applies to 3DS
environments where 3DSS, DS, and ACS functions are performed, while PCI DSS applies
wherever payment card account data is stored, processed or transmitted.

How should a 3DS entity manage an environment covered by both PCI 3DS and PCI
DSS?
If you're a 3DS entity that stores, processes, or transmits payment card account data,
you will have a defined 3DS environment (3DE) and a defined cardholder data
environment (CDE). If account data is present in the environment where 3DS functions
are performed, that environment would be considered both a 3DE and a CDE. Where the
3DE and CDE are combined in the same environment, you may be able to implement
security controls that meet requirements in both standards.

Whether you're required to validate compliance with the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard
and/or PCI DSS is defined by the individual payment brand compliance programs. For
more information, see the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard FAQ  document.

Where do I begin my organization's PCI 3DS compliance efforts for a solution
deployed on Azure?
The information that the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) makes available is a
good place to learn about specific compliance requirements. The PCI SSC publishes
the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard and supporting documents that explain how you
can help protect your 3DS transaction process. In addition to the Azure PCI 3DS
Attestation of Compliance (AoC), Microsoft provides guidance documents such as the
Azure PCI 3DS Shared Responsibility Matrix and Azure PCI 3DS whitepaper to help you
meet your own compliance requirements.

Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data
Security Standard (DSS)
Article • 03/14/2025

PCI DSS overview
The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) is a global information
security standard designed to prevent fraud through increased control of credit card
data. Organizations of all sizes must follow PCI DSS standards if they accept payment
cards from the five major credit card brands: Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
Discover, and the Japan Credit Bureau (JCB). Compliance with PCI DSS is required for
any organization that stores, processes, or transmits payment and cardholder data.

Microsoft and PCI DSS
Microsoft completed an annual PCI DSS assessment using an approved Qualified
Security Assessor (QSA). The auditors reviewed Microsoft Azure, Microsoft OneDrive for
Business, Microsoft SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Azure Communication Service
environments. This review included validating the infrastructure, development,
operations, management, support, and in-scope services. The PCI DSS designates four
levels of compliance based on transaction volume. Azure, OneDrive for Business,
SharePoint Online, and Azure Communication Service are certified as compliant under
PCI DSS version 4.0.1 at Service Provider Level 1 (the highest volume of transactions,
more than 6 million a year).

The assessment results in an Attestation of Compliance (AoC), which is available to
customers and Report on Compliance (RoC) issued by the QSA. The effective period for
compliance begins upon passing the audit and receiving the AoC from the assessor and
ends one year from the date the AoC is signed.

Customers who want to develop a cardholder environment or card processing service
can use these validations in many of the underlying portions, reducing the associated
effort and costs of getting their own PCI DSS certification.

It's important to understand that PCI DSS compliance status for Azure, OneDrive for
Business, SharePoint Online, and Azure Communication Service doesn't automatically
translate to PCI DSS certification for the services that customers build or host on these
platforms. Customers are responsible for ensuring that they achieve compliance with PCI
DSS requirements.

Office 365 and PCI DSS

Office 365 environments
Microsoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated
experience of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide.
Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their customer
data is located. Microsoft may replicate customer data to other regions within the same
geographic area (for example, the United States) for data resiliency, but Microsoft will
not replicate customer data outside the chosen geographic area.

This section covers the following Office 365 environments:

Client software (Client): commercial client software running on customer devices.
Office 365 (Commercial): the commercial public Office 365 cloud service available
globally.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC): the Office 365 GCC cloud
service is available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments,
and contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.



Office 365 Government Community Cloud - High (GCC High): the Office 365 GCC
High cloud service is designed according to Department of Defense (DoD) Security
Requirements Guidelines Level 4 controls and supports strictly regulated federal
and defense information. This environment is used by federal agencies, the
Defense Industrial Base (DIBs), and government contractors.
Office 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to
DoD Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal
and defense regulations. This environment is for the exclusive use by the US
Department of Defense.

Use this section to help meet your compliance obligations across regulated industries
and global markets. To find out which services are available in which regions, see the
International availability information  and the Where your Microsoft 365 customer data
is stored article. For more information about Office 365 Government cloud environment,
see the Office 365 Government Cloud article.

Your organization is wholly responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations. Information provided in this section does not constitute legal advice
and you should consult legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory
compliance for your organization.

Frequently asked questions
Why does the Attestation of Compliance (AoC) cover page say 'August 2024'?



The August 2024 date on the cover page is when the AoC template was published. Refer
to Section 2 for the dates of the assessment.

What is the relationship between the PA DSS and PCI DSS?

The Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS) is a set of requirements that
comply with the PCI DSS, and replaces Visa's Payment Application Best Practices, and
consolidates the compliance requirements of the other primary card issuers. The PA DSS
helps software publishers develop applications that store, process, or transmit
cardholder payment data as part of a card authorization or settlement process. Retailers
must use PA DSS certified applications to efficiently achieve their PCI DSS compliance.
The PA DSS doesn't apply to Azure.

What is an acquirer and does Azure use one?

An acquirer is a bank or other entity that processes payment card transactions. Azure
doesn't offer payment card processing as a service and thus doesn't use an acquirer.

To what organizations and merchants does the PCI DSS apply?

PCI DSS applies to any company, no matter the size, or number of transactions, that
accepts, transmits, or stores cardholder data. That is, if any customer ever pays a
company using a credit or debit card, then the PCI DSS requirements apply. Companies
are validated at one of four levels based on the total transaction volume over a 12-
month period. Level 1 is for companies that process over 6 million transactions a year;
Level 2 for 1 million to 6 million transactions; Level 3 is for 20,000 to 1 million
transactions; and Level 4 is for fewer than 20,000 transactions.

What is in-scope for OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online?

Currently, only files and documents uploaded to OneDrive for Business and SharePoint
Online are compliant with PCI DSS.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and
Insurance Regulatory and Development
Authority of India (IRDAI)
Article • 09/15/2023

About RBI and IRDAI
The Reserve Bank of India  (RBI), India's central banking institution, the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority of India  (IRDAI), and the Ministry of
Electronics and Information Technology  (MeitY) comprise three of the key financial
industry regulators overseeing banks, insurance organizations, and market infrastructure
institutions. Their directives include outsourcing and risk management guidelines and
requirements for compliance with privacy rules governing sensitive data.

Outsourcing and risk management guidance includes:

Guidelines on Managing Risk and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial
Services by Banks  (RBI) address the risks that regulated banks would be exposed
to while outsourcing financial services and help ensure that outsourcing doesn't
impede the supervisory role of the RBI. The RBI doesn't require prior approval for
banks seeking to outsource financial services; however, core banking functions,
such as internal audit and compliance functions, shouldn't be outsourced.
Guidelines on Information Security, Electronic Banking, Technology Risk
Management, and Cyber Frauds  (RBI). Financial institutions must report
outsourcing arrangements where the scale and nature of the activities are
significant or require extensive data sharing with service providers outside of India.
This guidance applies particularly if operational data is stored or processed outside
India.
Outsourcing of Activities by Indian Insurers Regulation  (IRDAI). Every year,
insurance organizations are required to report outsourcing to IRDAI of certain
support functions of core activities within 45 days of the close of the financial year.
Page 7 in the Microsoft checklist  describes what constitutes 'support functions of
core activities.'

Financial firms using cloud services must also comply with privacy rules, including the
Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive
Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011  (MeitY). Developed to strengthen India's
data protection laws, these rules govern the protection and handling of sensitive
personal data.



Microsoft, RBI, and IRDAI
To help guide financial institutions in India considering outsourcing business functions
to the cloud, Microsoft has published a compliance checklist for financial institutions in
India. By reviewing and completing the checklist , financial organizations can adopt
Microsoft business cloud services with the confidence that they're complying with
applicable regulatory requirements.

When Indian financial institutions outsource business activities to the cloud, they must
follow the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India for managing risk and addressing the
issues that arise from the use of information technology. They must also comply with
the data security and privacy requirements established by the Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology (MeitY). In addition, insurance organizations must follow
outsourcing guidelines published by the Insurance Regulatory and Development
Authority of India (IRDAI).

The Microsoft checklist helps financial firms in India that are conducting due-diligence
assessments of Microsoft business cloud services and includes:

An overview of the regulatory landscape for context.
A checklist that sets forth the issues to be addressed and maps Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Office 365 services against those

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Rule 17a-4, SEC Rule 18a-6, FINRA 4511, &
CFTC 1.31 United States
06/06/2025

About the SEC, FINRA, & CFTC
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  is an independent agency of the US
federal government and the primary overseer and regulator of US securities markets. It wields
enforcement authority over federal securities laws, proposes new securities rules, and oversees
market regulation of the securities industry.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is an independent, nongovernmental
organization that writes and enforces the rules governing registered brokers and broker-dealer
firms in the United States.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent federal agency that
regulates the derivatives markets, including futures contracts, options, and swaps, in the United
States. Its goals include the promotion of competitive and efficient markets and the protection
of investors against manipulation, abusive trade practices, and fraud. The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission Act established the CFTC in 1974.

These organizations define rigorous and explicit requirements for regulated entities that elect
to retain books and records on electronic storage media. Since these rules were first published,
there have been several updates and amendments over the years that seek to update these
rules in the context of modern storage systems and cloud services, introducing new
compliance options for financial institutions.

About SEC Rules 17a-4 and 18a-6
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) includes the following requirements. In 17 CFR §
240.17a4(f)(2) ("Rule 17a-4(f)") for the securities broker-dealer industry and 17 CFR §
240.18a6(e)(2) ("Rule 18a-6(e)") for security-based swap (SBS) dealers and major security-based
swap participants, the SEC stipulates requirements for electronic recordkeeping systems.
Effective January 3, 2023, the amended Rules require electronic recordkeeping systems to meet
either:

Option A, SEC Rules 17a-4(f)(2)(i)(A) and 18a-6(e)(2)(i)(A): Preserve a record for the
duration of its applicable retention period in a manner that maintains a complete time-



stamped audit trail that includes: (1) All modifications to and deletions of the record or any

SEC Regulation SCI (US)
Article • 09/25/2022

SEC Regulation SCI overview
The US Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) is an independent agency of the
US federal government and the primary regulator of US securities markets. It has
enforcement authority over federal securities laws, proposes new securities rules, and
oversees market regulation of the securities industry.

In November 2014, the SEC adopted Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity
(SCI) and Form SCI for reporting SCI events to bolster the technology infrastructure in
the US securities markets. The regulation is designed to reduce the frequency of system
outages, improve resiliency when such incidents occur, and increase SEC oversight of
securities markets technology and enforcement of its regulations.

The SCI rules apply to SCI entities, which include self-regulatory organizations (SROs)
such as stock and options exchanges, registered clearing agencies, and alternative
trading systems (ATSs). The rules primarily regulate the systems that directly support key
securities markets functions: trading, clearance and settlement, order routing, market
data, market regulation, and market surveillance.

Azure and SEC Regulation SCI
The SEC adopted Regulation SCI to strengthen the technology infrastructure of the
financial organizations that operate and support the US securities markets. Under SEC
oversight, its requirements are designed to ensure that these systems have high
availability, strong resiliency, and low latency (high volume of messages with little delay).

If you are a US financial services customer who must comply with this regulation, you
should review the Azure SEC Regulation SCI cloud implementation guide  published by
Microsoft. The guidance within this document:

Provides an overview of overall Azure capabilities that support strong resiliency,
high availability, and low latency.
Makes clear which control areas and regulatory aspects Azure addresses. This
point-by-point mapping of Azure features and services to SCI requirements
measures Azure compliance against the regulatory framework. It also helps you
understand where you can shift security responsibilities to Azure that you had fully



owned when you operated on premises. These capabilities are backed by the
promises Microsoft makes in Azure service level agreements (SLAs).
Specifies each Regulation SCI requirement that is your responsibility to address,
and offers Azure documentation and services to help you address these
responsibilities.

This document provides a thorough checklist of critical Regulation SCI focus areas. This
checklist helps you understand how you can adopt Azure to help assure your regulators,
customers, and leadership that you can comply with the applicable regulatory
requirements.

Applicability
Azure

Guidance documents
Microsoft has published the following guidance document:

Azure Regulation SCI cloud implementation guide  is intended to help you
address your SEC Regulation SCI compliance requirements.

How to implement
Regulation SCI cloud implementation guide  – maps Azure capabilities against
the regulation and details the shared responsibility for compliance.
Designing reliable Azure applications – a brief overview of how to build reliability
into each step of Azure application design.
Designing highly available applications – how developers can help ensure that
their Azure Storage applications are highly available.
Risk assessment and compliance guide for financial institutions in the Microsoft
Cloud  – create a governance model for risk assessment of Microsoft cloud
services, and regulator notification.

Frequently asked questions
What does shared responsibility mean when using cloud technology?
As computing environments move from on-premises data centers to the cloud, the
responsibility for application and data security also shifts as you now share the
responsibility with the cloud services provider (CSP). For every application and solution,



how much of that responsibility falls on you and how much on the CSP depends on the
cloud services model that you deploy: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. It is your responsibility to
understand to what degree you are accountable for implementing the required security
controls. However, Microsoft provides guidance to help you navigate this complex
dynamic. For more information, see Shared responsibility in the cloud.

Which financial institutions can take advantage of Azure to help meet Regulation SCI
requirements?
Financial organizations, or SCI entities, that are subject to this regulation can take
advantage of Azure. The SEC says its regulation applies to "certain self-regulatory
organizations (including registered clearing agencies), alternative trading systems (ATSs),
plan processors, and exempt clearing agencies (collectively, SCI entities), and will require
these SCI entities to comply with requirements with respect to the automated systems
central to the performance of their regulated activities."

Shared Assessments
Article • 09/25/2022

Shared Assessments overview
The Shared Assessments  Program (formerly known as BITS Shared Assessments) is
used by many commercial, retail, and investment banks around the world as a proxy for
managing their third-party vendor risk assessment process. Microsoft Azure aligns to
the Program’s Standard Information Gathering  (SIG) questionnaire and the Agreed
Upon Procedures  (AUP) by way of Azure’s CSA STAR Self-Assessment.

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)  Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk (STAR)  registry
is a free, publicly accessible registry in which cloud service providers (CSPs) can publish
their CSA-related assessments.

For security assessments, CSPs use the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)  to evaluate and
document their security controls. CCM is a controls framework composed of 197 control
objectives covering fundamental security principles across 17 domains to help cloud
customers assess the overall security risk of a CSP.

CSPs can submit the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)  to
document compliance with the CCM. The CAIQ contains more than 250 questions based
on the CCM that a customer or cloud auditor may want to ask of CSPs to assess their
compliance with CSA best practices.

STAR provides two levels of assurance :

Level 1: Self-Assessment using the CAIQ
Level 2: Independent third-party certifications such as CSA STAR Certification and
CSA STAR Attestation

For the CSA STAR Self-Assessment, Microsoft publishes CAIQ-based assessments for
Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365.

The CCM maps to the Shared Assessments SIG v6.0 and AUP v5.0. Azure also maintains
independent third-party certifications at the CSA STAR Level 2, including CSA STAR
Certification and CSA STAR Attestation as documented in the STAR registry.

７ Note



CSA CCM v3.0.1  provides control mapping to SIG v6.0 and AUP 5.0. It is expected
that the new CCM v4  will be updated to include this mapping as well.

Applicability
Azure

Attestation documents
To download Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365 CSA STAR Self-Assessments, see
the CSA STAR registry for Microsoft .

Frequently asked questions
Which industry standards does the CSA CCM align with?
The CCM maps to industry-accepted security standards, regulations, and control
frameworks such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, AICPA
Trust Services Criteria, and others. For the most current list, visit the CSA website .

Why is the CSA STAR self-assessment important?
It enables CSPs to document compliance with CSA published best practices in a
transparent manner. Self-assessment reports are publicly available, thereby helping you
gain visibility into the security practices of CSPs, and compare various CSPs using the
same baseline.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)
Article • 11/04/2024

SOX overview
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  (SOX) is a US federal law administered by the
Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC). Among other things, SOX requires
publicly traded companies to have proper internal control structures in place to validate
that their financial statements reflect their financial results accurately. SOX is heavily
influenced by customer’s internal processes especially when it comes to controls for
financial reporting. For example, SOX requirements involve internal customer controls
for the preparation and review of financial statements, and especially controls that affect
accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, and public disclosure of material changes related
to financial reporting.

The SEC doesn't define or impose a SOX certification process. Instead, it provides broad
guidelines for publicly traded companies to determine how to comply with SOX
reporting requirements.

Microsoft and SOX
Microsoft cloud services customers subject to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
(SOX) can use the SOC 1 Type 2 attestation that Microsoft received from an independent
auditing firm when addressing their own SOX compliance obligations. This attestation is
appropriate for reporting on internal controls over financial reporting.

Even though there's no SOX certification or validation for cloud service providers,
Microsoft can help customers meet their SOX obligations. For example, SOX requires
internal controls for the preparation and review of financial statements, especially
controls that affect the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, and public disclosure of
material changes related to financial reporting. To help companies, Microsoft maintains
a SOC 1 Type 2 attestation appropriate for reporting on such controls across a broad
portfolio of services that can be used to build a wide range of applications. It's based on
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement on Standards
for Attestation Engagements 18 (SSAE 18) and the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements No. 3402 (ISAE 3402). (This attestation replaced SAS 70.)

The audit report, produced by a third-party auditing firm, attests that Microsoft controls
were designed appropriately, in operation on a specified date, and operating effectively
over a specified time period. Customers can review the reports to learn about Microsoft



control objectives and the effectiveness of its controls, and get access to complementary
controls.

At Microsoft, we share the responsibility of compliance with our customers. We supply
the specifics about our compliance programs, which you can verify in the SOC audit
reports. Ultimately, however, it's up to you to determine whether our services comply
with the specific laws and regulations applicable to your business. For example, there
are SOX-related security controls, such as user access to cloud resources, that are your
responsibility: your organization must develop appropriate auditing of these controls as
part of your SOX compliance.

Azure, Dynamics 365, and SOX
As cloud adoption gains momentum, customers are increasingly exploring how to
migrate applications and workloads subject to SOX compliance obligations to the cloud.
Even though there's no SOX certification or validation for cloud service providers, Azure
can help you meet your SOX obligations.

If you're subject to SOX compliance obligations, you should review the Azure SOC 1
Type 2 attestation, which is performed according to:

SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes
AT-C section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service
Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(AICPA, Professional Standards).
SOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant
to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).

The AICPA SSAE 18 standard replaced SAS 70, and it's appropriate for reporting on
controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial
reporting. This is the formal audit that you can rely on for third-party reviews of
technology service providers when pursuing your own industry specific compliance



obligations for assets deployed on Azure. It includes auditor's opinion on control
effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified monitoring
period.

Health Data Hosting (HDS) France
Article • 11/04/2024

About HDS
The Hébergeurs de Données de Santé (HDS) certification is required for entities such as
cloud service providers that host the personal health data governed by French laws and
collected for delivering preventive, diagnostic, and other health services. The HDS
regulation was issued by ASIP SANTÉ  which, under the French Ministry of Health, is
responsible for promoting electronically based healthcare solutions in France.

Hosting of health data is regulated under French law by the French Public Health Code
(Article L.1111-8), which stipulates that any healthcare organization—hospitals,
pharmaceutical companies, laboratories—that handles personal medical data must use a
service provider that is HDS-certified. In April 2018, new Articles R1111-8-8 to R1111-11
of the Public Health Code took effect, changing the accreditation procedure from an
authorization by the French Ministry of Health to certification by an authorized body
such as BSI.

HDS certification requires that service providers implement measures that keep personal
health data secure, confidential, and accessible by patients. These measures include
strong authentication and authorization procedures, robust backup systems, and
powerful encryption methods. HDS also specifies mandatory provisions that must be
included in contracts with the cloud service provider. These requirements apply no
matter where the data is stored.

Microsoft and HDS
Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 have been granted the
Health Data Hosting (Hébergeurs de Données de Santé, HDS) certification, which is
required for all entities hosting personal health data governed by French law. This made
Microsoft the first major cloud service provider to meet the strict French standards for
storing and processing health data. This certification, required by the revision to the
2018 French Public Health Code, imposes advanced security and privacy requirements
on hosting services and cloud providers to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity
of sensitive data is adequately protected.

Microsoft compliance with the HDS requirements has been audited and certified by the
BSI Group , an independent certifying body accredited by French authorities to
conduct HDS audits.



The HDS certification enables healthcare providers in France to use Microsoft cloud
services to save costs by improving clinical and operational efficiency, and it opens the
door to the development of innovative, cutting-edge healthcare solutions. Providers are
able to develop smart applications or use third-party applications hosted on Azure to
implement predictive analytics to personalize healthcare, evaluate and treat patients at a
distance (telemedicine), and sharpen therapeutic drug monitoring.

The rigorous audit covered the measures Microsoft has taken to secure personal health
data and protect its confidentiality, including the:

ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management certification of Microsoft
cloud services, which are audited annually for compliance.
High level of privacy based on compliance with the GDPR and the ISO/IEC 27018
Code of Practice for Protecting Personal Data in the Cloud.

Audits, reports, and certificates
HDS certification  imposes advanced security and privacy requirements on hosting
services and cloud providers to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
data is adequately protected. Microsoft cloud services (including Azure) have been
granted the HDS certification, as shown on the ASIP Santé list of HDS-certified hosts .
Download the latest ASIP Sante HDS certificate from the Service Trust Portal: GRC
Assessment Reports  section.

How to implement
Contractual terms: French Public Health code requires the execution of specific
contractual terms between the health data hosting service or cloud service
provider and its customers. Eligible customers must reach out to their Microsoft
licensing point of contact to enter into these specific contractual terms before
hosting health personal data on Microsoft online services.
Health and life sciences: Case overviews, solution guides, tutorials, and other
resources to help build Azure solutions.

Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled
Substances (EPCS)
Article • 12/05/2022

EPCS overview
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled
Substances  (EPCS) is a rule that went into effect on 1 June 2010. It revised DEA
regulations for prescribers and pharmacies, allowing the e-prescribing of controlled
substances. The regulation provides pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the
ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while
maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances. Prescribers can
digitally sign, transmit, report, and archive electronic prescriptions, while pharmacies can
receive, dispense, and archive these electronic prescriptions.

The regulation covers:

Logical access controls for both prescribers and pharmacy systems
Multi-factor authentication for prescribers and administrators of prescribers
Digital signing of prescriptions for prescribers
Record keeping for both prescribers and pharmacies
Reporting and auditing of both prescribers and pharmacies
Data backups and archiving for both prescribers and pharmacies

DEA uses the following definitions for multi-factor authentication (MFA):

Two-factor credentials
Something you know – a knowledge factor
Something you have – a hard token stored separately from the computer being
accessed
Something you are – biometric information

Hard token
A cryptographic key stored on or a one-time password (OTP) transmitted to a
specialized hardware device (for example, a PDA, mobile phone, smart card, USB
key) rather than a general-purpose computer.

For more information, see Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1311.115
Additional requirements for two-factor authentication.

EPCS multi-factor authentication requirements



In EPCS, the DEA provides several requirements related to MFA for administrators of
prescribing systems, prescribers, and digital signing.

Two-factor authentication must be used to assign a prescriber within the electronic
system, approve a prescription entry, and digitally sign a prescription.
Two of the factors must be of the following three options: a username/password, a
hard token, or a biometric identification. The DEA has stated that the use of a type
of token or OTP generator must meet the same requirements as defined for a hard
token under the current regulation.
If a hard token is used, it must meet FIPS 140 Security Level 1 for cryptographic
devices or OTP devices.
The hard token must be stored on a device that is separate from the computer
being used to access the application.

EPCS token requirements and FIPS 140
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140  is a US government standard
that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information
technology products and systems. Testing against the FIPS 140 standard is maintained
by the Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP), a joint effort between the
US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for
Cyber Security, a branch of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada.
For more information, see Azure FIPS 140 documentation.

EPCS requires that solutions for hard tokens use cryptographic modules validated at
FIPS 140 Level 1 to ensure end users receive a high degree of security, assurance, and
non-repudiation. For more information, see Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part
1311.115  Additional requirements for two-factor authentication. The types of hard
tokens commonly used have either a cryptographic module as part of the token itself or
a random number generator, also called an OTP generator.

Azure and EPCS multi-factor authentication
As mentioned previously, two of the factors for EPCS multi-factor authentication must
be of the following three options:

1. Username/password
2. Hard token
3. Biometric identification

This section focuses on Azure support for hard tokens to meet EPCS multi-factor
requirements. There are several requirements specific to biometrics, as described in Title



21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1311.116  Additional requirements for biometrics.
However, these requirements aren't applicable to Azure.

The Microsoft Authenticator app provides an extra level of security to your Azure AD
account. It's available on mobile phones running Android and iOS. With the Microsoft
Authenticator app, you can provide secondary verification for MFA scenarios to meet
your EPCS MFA requirements. As mentioned previously, EPCS requires that solutions for
hard tokens use cryptographic modules validated at FIPS 140 Level 1 to ensure end
users receive a high degree of security, assurance, and non-repudiation. The Microsoft
Authenticator app meets FIPS 140 Level 1 validation requirements for all Azure AD
authentications, as explained in Authentication methods in Azure Active Directory -
Microsoft Authenticator app. FIPS 140 compliance for Microsoft Authenticator is
currently in place for iOS and in progress for Android.

Moreover, Azure can help you meet and exceed your EPCS MFA requirements by
supporting the highest Authenticator Assurance Level 3 (AAL3), as described in the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-63  Digital Identity
Guidelines. According to NIST SP 800-63B Section 4.3 , multi-factor authenticators
used at AAL3 shall rely on hardware cryptographic modules validated at FIPS 140 Level 2
overall with at least FIPS 140 Level 3 for physical security, which exceeds the EPCS MFA
requirements. Verifiers at AAL3 shall be validated at FIPS 140 Level 1 or higher.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports both authenticator and verifier NIST SP 800-
63B AAL3 requirements:

Authenticator requirements: FIDO2 security keys, smartcards, and Windows Hello
for Business can help you meet AAL3 requirements, including the underlying FIPS
140 validation requirements. Azure AD support for NIST SP 800-63B AAL3 exceeds
the EPCS multi-factor authentication requirements.
Verifier requirements: Azure AD uses the Windows FIPS 140 Level 1 overall
validated cryptographic module for all its authentication related cryptographic
operations. It is therefore a FIPS 140 compliant verifier.

For more information, see Azure NIST SP 800-63 documentation.

Food and Drug Administration CFR Title
21 Part 11
Article • 02/01/2024

FDA CFR Title 21 overview
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) contains the rules and regulations for executive
departments and agencies of the US federal government. Each of the 50 titles of the CFR
addresses a different regulated area.

FDA CFR Title 21  regulates food and drugs manufactured or consumed in the United
States, under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Drug
Enforcement Administration, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The
regulations outlined in CFR Title 21 Part 11 set the ground rules for the technology
systems that manage information used by organizations subject to FDA oversight. Any
technology system that governs such GxP processes as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP),
Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) also requires
validation of its adherence to GxP.

CFR Title 21 Part 11 sets requirements to ensure that electronic records and signatures
are trustworthy, reliable, and equivalent substitutes for paper records and handwritten
signatures. It also offers guidelines to improve the security of computer systems in FDA-
regulated industries. Subject companies must prove that their processes and products
work as they're designed to, and if these process and products change, they must
revalidate that proof. The best practices guidelines cover:

Standard operating procedures and controls that support electronic records and
signatures such as data backup, security, and computer system validation.
Features that ensure that the computer system is secure, contains audit trails for
data values, and ensures the integrity of electronic signatures.
Validation and documentation that supply evidence that the system does what is
intended, and that users can detect when the system isn't working as designed.

Microsoft and FDA CFR Title 21
Microsoft enterprise cloud services undergo regular independent third-party SOC 1 Type
2 and SOC 2 Type 2 audits and are certified according to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC
27018 standards.



Although these regular audits and certifications don't specifically focus on FDA
regulatory compliance, their purpose and objectives are similar in nature to those of CFR
Title 21 Part 11, and serve to help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
data stored in Microsoft cloud services. Our qualification approach is also based on
industry best practices, including the International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering (ISPE) GAMP series of Good Practices Guides and the Pharmaceutical
Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) Good Practices for Computerized Systems in
Regulated GxP Environments.

Customers can request access to the compliance reports, subject to nondisclosure
agreement terms and conditions, through their Microsoft account representative, or
through the Service Trust Portal .

Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services
Although there is no certification for complying with CFR Title 21 Part 11, the following
Microsoft enterprise cloud services have undergone independent, third-party audits,
which may help customers in their compliance efforts. These services include:

Azure: Cloud Services, Storage, Traffic Manager, Virtual Machines, and Virtual
Network
Azure DevOps
Intune
Dynamics 365 and Dynamics 365 U.S. Government
Office 365 and Office 365 U.S. Government

Audits, reports, and certificates
The audit reports for SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018
standards attest to the effectiveness of the controls Microsoft has implemented and
may help customers in their compliance with FDA CFR Title 21 Part 11.

Frequently asked questions
To whom does the standard apply?

FDA CFR Title 21 Part 11 applies to organizations with products and services that deal in
FDA-regulated aspects of the research, clinical study, maintenance, manufacturing, and
distribution of life science products.



How do Microsoft enterprise cloud services demonstrate compliance with FDA CFR
Title 21 Part 11?

Using the formal audits prepared by third parties for SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2,
ISO/IEC 27001, and ISO/IEC 27018, Microsoft is able to show how relevant controls
noted within these reports address the requirements.

Audited controls implemented by Microsoft help ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of data, and correspond to the applicable regulatory requirements
defined in Title 21 Part 11 that have been identified as the responsibility of Microsoft.
The qualification guidelines for Azure and Office 365 detail how Microsoft audit controls
correspond to those requirements.

How can I get copies of the auditor's reports?

The Service Trust Portal  provides independently audited compliance reports. You can
use the portal to request audit reports so that your auditors can compare Microsoft's
cloud services results with your own legal and regulatory requirement.

Can I use Microsoft's compliance in the certification process for my organization?

Yes. The independent third-party compliance reports of the IEC/ISO 27001, ISO/IEC
27018, SOC 1, and SOC 2 standards attest to the effectiveness of Microsoft controls.
Microsoft enterprise cloud customers may use the audited controls described in these
related reports as part of their own CFR Title 21 Part 11 risk analysis and qualification
efforts. Customers who build and deploy applications subject to FDA regulation are
responsible for ensuring that their applications meet FDA requirements.

What are Microsoft's responsibilities for maintaining compliance with this standard?

Microsoft ensures that its enterprise cloud services meet the terms defined within the
governing Online Services Terms  and applicable Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
These terms define our responsibility for implementing and maintaining controls
adequate to secure and monitor the system.

Good Clinical, Laboratory, and
Manufacturing Practices (GxP)
Article • 02/01/2024

About GxP
The term GxP is a general abbreviation for 'good practice' guidelines and regulations.
The 'x' represents a particular field—clinical (GCP), manufacturing (GMP), distribution
(GDP), laboratory (GLP), agriculture (GAP), and so on. There is no single regulatory entity
or administration; each country/region has its own guidelines and regulators, although
requirements are similar from country/region to country/region. GxP regulations include
those requirements outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) CFR Title 21
Part 11  and EudraLex Volume 4—GMP Guidelines, Annex 11  in the European Union
(EU).

Regulatory goals aim to make sure that businesses in regulated industries manufacture
products that are safe to use and meet stringent quality standards during the
production process. Computerized systems that use GxP processes require validation of
adherence to GxP requirements and are considered qualified when the system can
demonstrate its ability to fulfill them.

Microsoft and GxP
Microsoft can help organizations that deal with regulated aspects of the research,
clinical study, maintenance, manufacturing, and distribution of life science products and
services meet their requirements under Good Clinical, Laboratory, and Manufacturing
Practices (GxP). These include regulations enforced by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) under CFR Title 21 Part 11 for the security of computer systems
and the reliability and trustworthiness of electronic records, as well as EudraLex, Volume
4, Annex 11, recognized guidelines for computerized systems in the EU.

There is no GxP certification for cloud service providers; however:

Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 have undergone many independent
audits for quality management and information security, including ISO 9001 (QMS)
and ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS). This review includes regular audits of Microsoft
procedural and technical controls, verified for effectiveness.
The Microsoft qualification approach is also based on industry best practices,
including the Good Automated Manufacturing Practices (GAMP) series of Good



Practices Guides (from the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering
(ISPE)), and Good Practices for Computerized Systems in Regulated GxP
Environments (from the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) PI
011-3).

Although these standards and best practices do not specifically focus on GxP regulatory
compliance, their purpose and objectives are similar and help ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of data stored in Microsoft cloud services.

Microsoft retained Montrium , an independent organization specializing in quality
assurance and regulatory GxP compliance for the life sciences industry, to conduct the
GxP qualification review for Microsoft. The resulting Qualification Guidelines for Office
365  are intended for life sciences organizations that plan to use these cloud services
to host and support GxP-regulated computerized systems. The guidelines identify the
responsibility shared by Microsoft and its customers for meeting GxP requirements, as
well as recommend activities and controls that customers using in-scope Microsoft
cloud services can establish to maintain control over GxP computerized systems. See
GxP (FDA 21 CFR Part 11) for more information about GxP in Azure.

Life sciences organizations building GxP solutions on Azure and Office 365 can take
advantage of the cloud's efficiencies while also protecting patient safety, product
quality, and data integrity. Customers also benefit from multiple layers of security and
governance technologies, operational practices, and compliance policies that enforce
data privacy and integrity at specific levels.

Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) & Health
Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health (HITECH) Act
07/29/2025

HIPAA and the HITECH Act overview
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the regulations
issued under HIPAA are a set of U.S. healthcare laws that establish requirements for the use,
disclosure, and safeguarding of individually identifiable health information. The scope of HIPAA
was extended with the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009.

HIPAA applies to covered entities (specifically, health care providers, health plans, and health
care clearinghouses) that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or access patients' protected
health information (PHI). HIPAA further applies to business associates of covered entities that
perform certain functions or activities involving PHI as part of providing services to the covered
entity or on behalf of the covered entity.

When a covered entity engages the services of a cloud service provider, such as Microsoft, the
cloud service provider would be a business associate under HIPAA. Moreover, when a business
associate subcontracts with a cloud service provider to create, receive, maintain, or transmit
PHI, the cloud service provider also becomes a business associate.

Microsoft, HIPAA, and the HITECH Act
HIPAA regulations require that covered entities (defined under the Rules) enter into
agreements with business associates to ensure that PHI is adequately protected. This
agreement is called a Business Associate Agreement. Among other things, a Business Associate
Agreement establishes the permitted and required uses and disclosures of PHI by the business
associate, based on the relationship between the parties and the activities or services being
performed by the business associate. To support our customers' compliance with HIPAA when
utilizing Microsoft enterprise products and services, Microsoft will enter into Business Associate
Agreements with its covered entity and business associate customers.

There is currently no certification standard that is approved by the Department of Health and
Human Services to demonstrate compliance with HIPAA or the HITECH Act by a business



associate. However, Microsoft enables customers in their compliance with HIPAA and the
HITECH Act and adheres to the Security Rule requirements of HIPAA in its capacity as a
business associate. Moreover, Microsoft enters into Business Associate Agreements with its
covered entity and business associate customers to support their compliance with HIPAA
obligations.

Third-party certifications
Microsoft services covered under the BAA have undergone audits conducted by accredited
independent auditors for the Microsoft ISO/IEC 27001 certification and the HITRUST Common
Security Framework (CSF) certification.

Microsoft enterprise cloud services are also covered by FedRAMP assessments. Microsoft Azure
and Microsoft Azure Government received a Provisional Authority to Operate from the
FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board; Microsoft Dynamics 365 U.S. Government received an
Agency Authority to Operate from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as
did Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.

Frequently asked questions
Can my organization enter into a BAA with Microsoft?

Yes. Microsoft offers its covered entity and business associate customers a Business Associate
Agreement that covers in-scope Microsoft services.

The Microsoft HIPAA Business Associate Agreement  is available through the Microsoft Online
Services Data Protection Addendum by default to all customers who are covered entities or



business associates under HIPAA. See 'Microsoft in-scope cloud services' on this webpage for
the list of cloud services covered by this BAA.

The HIPAA Business Associate Agreement is also available for in-scope Microsoft Professional
Services upon. Contact your Microsoft services representative for more information.

Does having a Business Associate Agreement with Microsoft ensure my organization's
compliance with HIPAA and the HITECH Act?

No. By offering a Business Associate Agreement, Microsoft helps support your HIPAA
compliance. However, using Microsoft services does not on its own achieve HIPAA compliance.
Your organization is responsible for ensuring that you have an adequate compliance program
and internal processes in place, and that your particular use of Microsoft services aligns with
your obligations under HIPAA and the HITECH Act.

Can Microsoft use my organization's Business Associate Agreement?

No, Microsoft cannot use a customer's Business Associate Agreement. Because we offer
hyperscale, multitenant services that are standardized for all our customers, we must operate in
a consistent manner. The Microsoft HIPAA Business Associate Agreement closely reflects how
we operate. Accordingly, in order to address the needs of the healthcare industry, Microsoft
collaborated with a consortium of academic medical centers and other public and private
sector entities within healthcare to create a Business Associate Agreement that aligns with our
scale service offerings and meets the needs of customers.

How can I get copies of third party audit reports?

The Service Trust Portal  provides independently audited compliance reports. You can use the
portal to request audit reports so that your auditors can compare Microsoft's cloud services
results with your own legal and regulatory requirements. Azure customers can also retrieve
Azure certificates and audit reports in the Azure portal through the audit reports blade in
Microsoft Defender for Cloud .

How can I learn more about how Microsoft supports compliance with HIPAA and the
HITECH Act?

Health Information Trust Alliance
(HITRUST) Common Security Framework
(CSF)
Article • 03/16/2023

HITRUST CSF overview
The Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is an organization governed by
representatives from the healthcare industry. HITRUST created and maintains the
Common Security Framework (CSF), a certifiable framework to help healthcare
organizations and their providers demonstrate their security and compliance in a
consistent and streamlined manner.

The CSF builds on HIPAA and the HITECH Act, which are US healthcare laws that have
established requirements for the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of individually
identifiable health information, and that enforce noncompliance. HITRUST provides a
benchmark — a standardized compliance framework, assessment, and certification
process — against which cloud service providers and covered health entities can
measure compliance. The CSF also incorporates healthcare-specific security, privacy, and
other regulatory requirements from such existing frameworks as the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS ), ISO/IEC 27001  information security
management standards, and Minimum Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-
E ).

The CSF is divided into 19 different domains, including endpoint protection, mobile
device security, and access control. HITRUST certifies IT offerings against these controls.
HITRUST also adapts requirements for certification to the risks of an organization based
on organizational, system, and regulatory factors.

Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) Common Security Framework (CSF)

HITRUST offers three degrees of assurance, or levels of assessment: self-assessment, CSF
validated, and CSF-certified. Each level builds with increasing rigor on the one below it.
An organization with the highest level, CSF-certified, meets all the certification
requirements of the CSF. Microsoft Azure and Office 365 are the first hyperscale cloud
services to receive certification for the HITRUST CSF. Coalfire, a HITRUST assessor firm,
performed the assessments based on how Azure and Office 365 implement security,
privacy, and regulatory requirements to protect sensitive information. Microsoft
supports the HITRUST Shared Responsibility Program.

Frequently asked questions
Why are some Office 365 services not in the scope of this certification?



Microsoft provides the most comprehensive offerings compared to other cloud service
providers. To keep up with our broad compliance offerings across regions and
industries, we include services in the scope of our assurance efforts based on the market
demand, customer feedback, and product lifecycle. If a service isn't included in the
current scope of a specific compliance offering, your organization has the responsibility
to assess the risks based on your compliance obligations and determine the way you
process the data in that service. We continuously collect feedback from customers and
work with regulators and auditors to expand our compliance coverage to meet your
security and compliance needs.

Does Microsoft certification mean that if my organization uses Office 365, it is
compliant with HITRUST CSF?

When you store your data in a SaaS like Office 365, it's a shared responsibility between
Microsoft and your organization to achieve compliance. Microsoft manages majority of
the infrastructure controls including physical security, network controls, application level
controls, etc., and your organization has the responsibility to manage access controls
and protect your sensitive data. The Office 365 HITRUST certification demonstrates the
compliance of Microsoft's control framework. Building on that, your organization needs
to implement and maintain your own data protection controls to meet HITRUST CSF
requirements.

Does Microsoft provide guidance for my organization to implement appropriate
controls when using Office 365?

Yes, you can find recommended customer actions in Compliance Manager, cross-
Microsoft Cloud solutions that help your organization meet complex compliance
obligations when using cloud services. Specifically, for HITRUST CSF, we recommend
that you perform risk assessments using the NIST 800-53 and NIST CSF assessments in
Compliance Manager. In the assessments, we provide you with step-by-step guidance
and the Microsoft solutions you can use to implement your data protection controls.

MARS-E (US)
Article • 04/05/2023

MARS-E overview
In 2012, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) published the Minimum
Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-E) in accordance with CMS information
security and privacy programs. The suite of documents, including guidance,
requirements, and templates, was designed to address mandates of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and regulations of the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) that apply to the ACA. The National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53  Security and Privacy Controls for Information
Systems and Organizations serves as the parent framework that establishes the security
and compliance requirements for all systems, interfaces, and connections between ACA-
mandated health exchanges and marketplaces.

Following the release of MARS-E, NIST released an update, SP 800-53 Rev. 4, to address
growing challenges to online security, including application security; insider and
advanced persistent threats; supply chain risks; and the trustworthiness, assurance, and
resilience of systems of mobile and cloud computing. CMS then revised the MARS-E
framework to align with the updated controls and parameters in NIST 800-53 Rev. 4,
publishing MARS-E 2.0 in 2015. For more information, see Minimum Acceptable Risk
Standards .

The MARS-E 2.0 updates address the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
protected data in health exchanges, which includes personally identifiable information,
protected health information, and federal tax information. The MARS-E 2.0 framework
aims to secure this protected data and applies to all ACA administering entities,
including exchanges or marketplaces, federal, state, state Medicaid, or Children’s Health
Insurance Program (CHIP) agencies, and their supporting contractors.

Azure and MARS-E
There's no formal authorization or certification process for MARS-E. However, the
MARS-E framework is aligned with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, which serves as the baseline
control set for the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
Therefore, a FedRAMP assessment and authorization provides a strong foundation for
evaluating MARS-E requirements mapped to NIST SP 800-53 controls.



Microsoft maintains a FedRAMP High authorization for both Azure and Azure
Government issued by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB). Although
FedRAMP doesn't specifically focus on MARS-E, the MARS-E control requirements
and objectives are very closely aligned with FedRAMP and serve to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data on Azure.
An accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO) has attested that both
Azure and Azure Government meet the applicable requirements of MARS-E. The
attestation was based on an analysis of the security controls defined in the MARS-E
catalog to determine Azure and Azure Government compliance status based on
existing assessments such as FedRAMP. The result of this analysis was that
additional controls that are required as part of the MARS-E catalog were added to
assessment scope to demonstrate compliance with the security controls defined in
the MARS-E catalog.

Frequently asked questions
To whom does the standard apply?
MARS-E applies to all Affordable Care Act administering entities, including exchanges or
marketplaces, federal, state, Medicaid, and CHIP agencies administering the Basic Health
Program, as well as all their contractors and subcontractors.



How does Azure demonstrate adherence to this standard?
Using the formal FedRAMP assessment and authorization program, Microsoft is able to
show how relevant controls in the underlying NIST SP 800-53 control baseline
demonstrate Azure alignment with MARS-E security and privacy requirements. Starting
with the FedRAMP control baseline, an accredited third-party assessment organization
(3PAO) identified additional controls required for Azure and Government to
demonstrate compliance with the security controls defined in the MARS-E catalog. After
these additional controls were successfully tested, the 3PAO produced attestation letters
to confirm that Azure and Azure Government meet the applicable MARS-E
requirements.

How can I get the Azure MARS-E attestation documents?
For links to audit documentation, see Attestation documents.

How can I use Microsoft's support for MARS-E in my own assessment?
You can review available Azure and Azure Government FedRAMP documentation for
evidence of control effectiveness that Microsoft has implemented to maintain the
security and privacy of the Azure platform. You may use the audited controls described
in FedRAMP documentation as part of your own MARS-E compliance assessment.
Microsoft doesn't inspect, approve, or monitor your applications deployed on Azure.
You're wholly responsible for ensuring your own compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations.

NEN 7510
Article • 05/28/2025

NEN 7510 overview
Organizations in the Netherlands that process patient health information must demonstrate
control over that data and their organization consistent with the requirements set out in the
NEN 7510 standard. Microsoft isn't itself subject to NEN 7510, but its cloud customers in the
healthcare sector need to establish that they comply with NEN 7510 regarding solutions built
on the Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft cloud services undergo various periodic certifications and
audits, some of which include elements closely related to requirements specified in NEN 7510.

Microsoft and NEN 7510:2011
Microsoft has analyzed our current certifications and assurance statements and created a NEN
7510 coverage report  (available on the Service Trust Platform), which maps those
certifications and assurance statements against the NEN 7510 controls for which Microsoft is
responsible as a cloud service provider. This document can help customers determine which
other controls they must implement to ensure that their use of Microsoft cloud services for the
storage or processing of patient health information complies with NEN 7510.

Azure and Office 365 NEN 7510:2011 Standard Coverage

Frequently asked questions
Is a customer that uses Microsoft cloud services compliant with NEN 7510?

Demonstrating NEN compliance is the responsibility of the healthcare organization (the
'customer'). When customers use a cloud services vendor, they typically demand assurances
from the vendor, and add their own (other) technology and organizational decisions, choices,
and processes. This effort results in an overall assessment by the customer on its NEN 7510
compliance, which can be submitted for review or certification to a third-party auditor. The
NEN 7510 coverage report provides insight into which NEN 7510 controls are covered by
Microsoft cloud services, but, as such, doesn't cover end-to-end compliance.

Is Microsoft compliant with NEN 7510?

The responsibility for NEN 7510 compliance is applicable to Dutch Healthcare organizations. It
requires the organization to implement an information security management system and to
address risk with appropriate technical and organizational measures. For Microsoft in its role as
cloud service provider, NEN 7510 compliance isn't the objective, nor is it technically feasible.
When a customer implements or uses Microsoft cloud services, those services might be in
scope of a NEN 7510 evaluation. However, the organization must add its own (other) controls,
choices, and processes that are part of the overall NEN 7510 evaluation. The objective of the
report is to demonstrate that a Healthcare entity can adopt the Microsoft cloud services in a
manner that is compliant with NEN 7510.

The report does not show 100% coverage. Is NEN 7510 compliance not feasible?

Microsoft cloud services provide many controls that help organizations within Dutch
Healthcare with their NEN 7510 compliance needs. However, an organization needs to
complement those vendor assurances with their own implementation choices, other
technology controls, and administrative processes. The report shows already over 94% direct
coverage of the full list of applicable controls. For the remaining controls, Microsoft provides
guidance in the report on how compliance with those controls can be demonstrated.



７ Note

Implementing the full list of controls isn't the primary purpose of NEN 7510 (although the
large coverage of Microsoft Online Services does help). NEN 7510 mandates the
implementation of a risk-based information security system that can be used by an
organization to determine which controls are applicable to them.

Is the NEN 7510 coverage report a legal binding document?

No. It's a supporting tool for the customer's internal NEN 7510 assurance process and helps to
establish confidence and trust that NEN 7510 compliance is feasible. The report (created by
independent auditor, KPMG) has a descriptive status and includes a legal disclaimer.

Did Microsoft pay for the report?

Microsoft created a mapping between its global assurances to the controls in the NEN 7510
standard. Microsoft then hired KPMG (an independent auditor) to perform an independent
review on the control mapping to NEN 7510, which resulted in the report.

Can we share this report?

The report is provided with you under a non-disclosure agreement, on the basis that it is for
customer information only, and that it will not be copied or disclosed via other channels than
the Microsoft Service Trust Portal.

Customers can share the report with their own internal or external auditor as part of their
compliance or assurance processes.

CDSA
Article • 04/04/2023

CDSA overview
The Content Delivery & Security Association  (CDSA) is a worldwide forum advocating
for the innovative and responsible delivery and storage of entertainment, software, and
information content. CDSA provides community, collaboration, and communications
services that protect entertainment media throughout the supply chain. In 2018, CDSA
and the Motion Picture Association  (MPA) launched the Trusted Partner Network
(TPN) to help the industry improve content security, simplify assessments, and enable
content owners to gauge their level of conformance to the MPA content protection best
practices .

The CDSA Content Protection & Security (CPS) Standard  provides guidance and
requirements for securing media assets within a Content Security Management System
(CSMS). The standard specifies a set of controls designed to ensure the integrity of
intellectual property and the confidentiality and security of media assets at every stage
of the digital media supply chain.

The CPS certification audit used to be administered directly by CDSA. It consists of over
300 distinct controls that help secure and manage physical data centers, harden
services, and protect storage facilities. All controls are optimized to handle sensitive and
valuable media assets. Once a system was validated by the CDSA assessor, CDSA would
issue a certificate of compliance. To maintain compliance, the certified entity was
required to submit the results of annual audits to CDSA.

Since launching the TPN, both the MPA and CDSA have ceased their individual security
assessment programs to focus on managing and developing the TPN program and TPN
annual assessments. Past audits or assessments will remain valid for the period originally
indicated but will not be renewable within their individual programs. For both the MPA
and CDSA, the primary focus is to provide a unified assessment program through the
TPN.

Azure and CDSA
Microsoft Azure Media Services was the first hyper-scale cloud services media platform
certified to comply with the CDSA CPS standard, offering powerful and highly scalable
cloud-based encoding, encryption, and streaming capabilities. These features enable the
creation and distribution of internal digital work products, as well as the distribution and



monetization of premium digital content to a global audience using today’s most
popular digital devices. The CPS certification provides a standards-based assurance that
the intellectual property rights of media assets stored, managed, and distributed from
within Azure are protected.

７ Note

Since launching the TPN, CDSA has ceased its individual security assessment
program to focus on managing and developing the TPN program and TPN annual
assessments together with the MPA. Past CDSA audits will remain valid for the
period originally indicated but will not be renewable within the corresponding
assessment program. The primary focus for both the MPA and CDSA is to provide a
unified assessment program through the TPN.

Therefore, the Azure CDSA CPS certificate and audit report have not been renewed
since they were last issued – they are made available for historical reasons.
However, the Azure CDSA CPS implementation guidance continues to provide
valuable insight into Azure capabilities aimed at protecting the intellectual property
rights of media assets stored, managed, and distributed from within Azure.

The Azure CDSA CPS implementation guide  is available for download from the Service
Trust Portal Media and Entertainment  section. It describes how Azure Media Services
can help you create CDSA CPS compliant solutions securely and how you can create,
protect, and operate digital media services on Azure.

Azure Media Services was the first hyper-scale cloud media platform to offer encryption
on the fly for both video on demand and live-streaming broadcasts. Azure Media
Services provides several security-enhanced upload channels for content, including the
ExpressRoute private network connection to Azure, UDP upload via the Aspera client,
and HTTPS upload over the Internet.

Audit reports and certificates
For instructions on how to access audit reports and certificates, see Audit
documentation.

You can download the following documents from from the Service Trust Portal Media
and Entertainment  section. These documents are no longer being renewed because
CDSA ceased their own individual assessment program to focus on managing and
developing the TPN program and TPN assessments. The Azure Media Services CDSA
certificate and audit report are made available for historical reasons.

Frequently asked questions
What is the significance of Azure Media Services CDSA certification?
Since launching the TPN, CDSA ceased its own security assessment program to focus on
managing and developing a unified assessment program through the TPN together with
the MPA. However, Azure Media Services was the first hyper-scale cloud services media
platform certified to comply with the CDSA CPS standard while the CDSA assessment
program was operational. This certification demonstrates that the intellectual property
rights of media assets stored, managed, and distributed from within Azure are protected
according to a well-respected industry standard.

Moreover, the Azure CDSA CPS implementation guidance provides valuable insight into
Azure capabilities aimed at protecting the intellectual property rights of media assets
stored, managed, and distributed from within Azure. It describes how Azure Media
Services can help you create CDSA CPS compliant solutions securely and how you can
create, protect, and operate digital media services on Azure.

Does my organization still need to undergo a TPN assessment?
Production facilities, visual effects houses, and other service partners should work with
their executive producers and directors to understand the new security requirements,
including the annual TPN assessment. You can hire a qualified TPN assessor and then
manage your assessment process using the secure online platform. The TPN assessment
does not provide a “pass/fail” grade, certification, or rating. It provides an assessment of
a facility’s security preparedness for conformance with the MPA content security best
practices. If an assessment indicates non-conformance with a security best practices
control, you can validate remediation via follow-up assessment or furnish your own
evidence of remediation to the TPN.

Since launching the TPN, both the MPA and CDSA have ceased their individual security
assessment programs to focus on managing and developing the TPN program and TPN
annual assessments. Past audits or assessments will remain valid for the period originally
indicated but will not be renewable within their individual programs. For both the MPA
and CDSA, the primary focus is to provide a unified assessment program through the
TPN.

DPP (UK)
Article • 09/25/2022

DPP overview
Broadcasters are confronting increasingly frequent cyber attacks against their websites,
IT infrastructure, and systems. In response to these threats, the Digital Production
Partnership  (DPP) partnered with the North American Broadcasters Association
(NABA) to develop the NABA DPP Broadcasters Cyber Security Requirements for
Suppliers . Chief information security officers from UK broadcasters have endorsed
these requirements as the minimum set of requirements for cyber security.

The DPP then worked with broadcasters and supplier security experts to create a self-
assessment program designed to enable suppliers to demonstrate commitment to
achieving security best practices. This work led to the establishment of a formal
Committed to Security Program that DPP launched in October 2017 with two different
marks: Broadcast and Production. A checklist and user guide are provided by the DPP
for each of the two marks.

Azure and DPP
Microsoft Azure has been awarded the DPP Committed to Security Mark for Broadcast
after completing the DPP self-assessment questionnaire, the Committed to Security
Broadcast Checklist. Microsoft Azure submission required documenting control
implementation details for a set of security requirements spanning documentation and
testing, authentication, and security. Eurofins Digital Testing , a quality assurance
expert and DPP member, reviewed and signed off on the Microsoft response, and
submitted it to the DPP for final validation and display on the DPP committed to
security  landing page. The Azure Committed to Security Broadcast mark is valid for
one year and renewed annually.

The DPP validation means that broadcasters and other media customers using Azure
can be confident that the robust, secure, and resilient cloud services available to them
can help meet the unique demands of the broadcast industry, from program
development to transmission.

FACT (UK)
Article • 04/05/2023

FACT overview
The Federation Against Copyright Theft  (FACT) was formed in 1983 to protect the
content, product, and interests of the film and television industries. Copyrighted content
comes in many forms—pictures, videos, music, contracts, scripts, workflows, art,
architecture, and more—and represents the core assets of many businesses. Piracy
threatens to undermine the very existence of these businesses through the unlawful
distribution of intellectual property (IP) for illicit gain or market disruption. As
production and post-production workflows increasingly move to the cloud, the black
market for intellectual property is similarly moving away from physical media toward
online resources. FACT investigates cyber crime, fraud, and other IP crime.

Azure and FACT
７ Note

FACT security certification program is no longer maintained – this article is provided
for historical reasons. Azure was the first hyper-scale, multi-tenant public cloud to
achieve FACT certification.

To underscore Microsoft’s commitment to protect your copyrighted assets entrusted to
the public cloud, Azure has been certified by the Federation Against Copyright Theft
(FACT) in the United Kingdom. Azure was the first hyper-scale, multi-tenant public cloud
to achieve FACT certification.

FACT security certification provides assurances that an organization is delivering high
quality secure processes and solutions. It is based on the ISO/IEC 27001 standard,
focusing on physical and digital security, staff screening and training, access control, and
other security domains. The FACT content protection and security program draws on
expertise across law enforcement, technology partners, and industry associations to
fight copyright infringement and content theft, such as peer-to-peer sharing, illegal disc
duplication, and signal theft.

Frequently asked questions



Why is FACT important?
Content security is critical for feature film and television development, as there are
multiple points along the workflow where digital assets can be compromised or stolen.
By passing the FACT audit, Azure provides you with another layer of assurance by
helping prevent the illegal distribution and sale of film and television assets.

Does my organization still need to undergo a FACT audit, or can we use the Azure
audit?
Compliance with FACT is voluntary, but Microsoft elected to carry out an independent
assessment so that you can be confident in the content security and protection
capabilities of Azure. However, Microsoft doesn't inspect, approve, or monitor your
applications deployed on Azure. Your individual cloud environment isn't managed by
Microsoft and may be subject to additional regulation that is best addressed by an
individual audit.

Motion Picture Association (MPA)
Article • 03/21/2023

MPA overview
The Motion Picture Association  (MPA) provides content protection best practices
and control frameworks to help major studio partners and vendors design infrastructure
and solutions to ensure the security of digital film assets.

The Trusted Partner Network  (TPN) is a new, global, industry-wide film and television
content production initiative. It was launched in 2018 by MPA and the Content Delivery
& Security Association (CDSA), the worldwide leaders in third-party entertainment
industry assessments. The TPN program helps companies prevent leaks, breaches, and
hacks of movies and television shows prior to their intended release. TPN is owned and
managed by MPA. TPN has been developed to help the industry improve content
security, simplify assessments, and enable content owners to gauge their level of
conformance to the MPA content security best practices.

７ Note

Since launching the TPN, MPA has ceased their individual security assessment
programs to focus on managing and developing the TPN program and TPN annual
assessments. Past audits or assessments will remain valid for the period originally
indicated but won't be renewable within their individual programs. The primary
focus for MPA is to provide a unified assessment program through the TPN.

MPA continues to maintain and update their content security best practices. A TPN
assessment doesn't provide a “pass/fail” grade, certification, or rating. It provides an
assessment of a facility’s security preparedness for conformance with the MPA content
security best practices.

Azure and MPA
In February 2016, Microsoft Azure became the first hyper-scale, multi-tenant cloud
services platform to successfully complete a formal assessment by independent MPA
auditors, and comply with all three of the MPA content security best practices
frameworks: Common, Application, and Cloud Security Guidelines.



The MPA assessment covers 48 security topics in the Common Guidelines and an
additional six in the Application and Cloud Security Guidelines. These topics are built on
industry-accepted security standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, and
are aligned to industry best practices, such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud
Controls Matrix (CCM).

The formal assessment of Azure compliance means that companies who do business
with major studios can use Azure to help reduce the IT costs that are normally
associated with the secure creation, management, storage, and distribution of content
while complying with MPA requirements. Azure Media Services, Storage, Virtual
Network, and more than 30 other services provide a content workflow engine in the
cloud that you can use to build secure and scalable production processes while
protecting media assets downstream.

Azure has released guidance documentation to help you implement your solutions that
meet MPA security best practices.

Guidance documents
For instructions on how to access audit reports and certificates, see Audit
documentation. You can download the following guidance documents from the Service
Trust Portal (STP) Media and Entertainment  section:

Azure responses to MPA common guidelines
Azure responses to MPA application and cloud security guidelines

Extra guidance documents are available:

Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure hardening guide
Editorial and asset management hardening guide for Azure
Azure media hardening guide for 3D graphics rendering

Frequently asked questions
Why are the MPA best practices important?
Content security is critical for feature film development as there are multiple points
along the workflow where digital assets could be compromised or stolen. Dailies, rough
cuts, and visual effects are just some of the materials exposed during a normal
production cycle, and the box office impact of a security breach on a blockbuster project
can reach tens of millions of dollars.



MPA guidelines provide major studio vendors and partners with a set of best practices
for creating, processing, storing, and distributing digital assets. Cloud service platforms
such as Azure can provide an extra layer of assurance that content uploaded to the
cloud will be managed in accordance with established industry requirements for
encryption, authentication, access control, resiliency, and others.

Does my organization still need to undergo a TPN assessment, or can we rely on
Azure MPA assessments?
Production facilities, visual effects houses, and other service partners should work with
their executive producers and directors to understand the new security requirements,
including the annual TPN assessment. You can hire a qualified TPN assessor and then
manage your assessment process using the secure online platform. The TPN assessment
doesn't provide a “pass/fail” grade, certification, or rating. It provides an assessment of a
facility’s security preparedness for conformance with the MPA content security best
practices. If an assessment indicates non-conformance with a security best practices
control, you can validate remediation via a follow-up assessment or furnish your own
evidence of remediation to TPN.

Compliance with MPA content protection best practices is voluntary – MPA doesn't
provide an accreditation program. Best practices outline security expectations and
provide a framework for assessing facility's ability to protect content. Microsoft elected
to carry out an independent MPA assessment so that you can be confident in the
content security and protection capabilities of Azure. However, Microsoft doesn't
inspect, approve, or manage your applications deployed on Azure. You're wholly
responsible for ensuring your own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

GSMA
Article • 05/06/2025

GSMA overview
The Global System for Mobile Communications Association  (GSMA) is an industry
organization that "represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, uniting more than
750 operators with almost 400 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem, including handset
and device makers, software companies, equipment providers and internet companies, as well
as organizations in adjacent industry sectors." The GSMA established the Security Accreditation
Scheme  (SAS) to enable mobile operators to assess the security of their Universal Integrated
Circuit Card (UICC) and embedded UICC (eUICC) suppliers, as well as their eUICC subscription
management service providers. Two schemes operate under SAS:

SAS for UICC Production (SAS-UP) is a well-established scheme through which UICC and
eUICC manufacturers subject their production sites and processes to a comprehensive
security audit.
SAS for Subscription Management (SAS-SM) is a related security auditing and
accreditation scheme for the providers of eUICC subscription management services,
intended to ensure industry confidence in the security of remote provisioning for eUICCs.

The GSMA’s established Security Accreditation Scheme (SAS) is the required security
accreditation for embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) entities handling sensitive
assets, including mobile network operator (MNO) profile information and digital certificates.
SAS-SM audits the robustness of processes for secure data management at the subscription
management service location.

Azure and GSMA
Azure has obtained the GSMA SAS-SM accreditation for data center operations and
management across the following regions:

Central US
East US
East US 2

France Central
France South
Germany West Central
Japan East



Japan West
North Europe
Sweden Central
West Europe

The GSMA accreditation of Azure regions with more than 200 available Azure and other
Microsoft cloud services is the first for any hyper-scale cloud provider. The independent
standalone accreditation enables any telecom operator to use the Azure cloud services
platform to support a massive global increase in the volume of embedded mobile
subscriptions with the right level of security assurance. This capability will be critical to the
implementation of 5G networks and the cellular network connectivity of billions of IoT devices
worldwide.

Microsoft solutions for telecommunications  let you use AI and automation to increase
telecommunication network efficiency, scalability, and reliability. These solutions help you
capitalize on new service opportunities enabled by 5G. Azure is set to play a key role in helping
telecommunications providers build 5G networks with Azure Edge Zones , connecting Azure
services directly to 5G networks in the carrier’s data center.

Azure Private 5G Core is available as a part of the Azure private multi-access edge compute

25.326 (PDPA) (Ley de Protección de los Datos Personales ) was executed in 2000 to
help protect the privacy of personal data, and to give individuals access to any
information stored in public and private databases and registries. The Argentine Agency
of Access to Public Information (Agencia de Acceso a la Información Pública , AAIP)
within the Chief of Ministries' Cabinet is responsible for enforcing this law.

The PDPA aligns with the European legislative model for protecting data privacy, and
Argentina was the first country/region in Latin America to achieve an 'adequacy'
qualification for data transfers from the EU.

In 2016, the AAIP issued a new regulation, Provision 60-E/2016  (Spanish), governing
cross-border transfers of personal data. Under the rule, it approved model forms (partly
based on the data transfer model in the EU) for such transfers to data controllers and
data processors.

Microsoft and the PDPA
Microsoft contractually commits through the Microsoft Online Services Terms  that our
in-scope business cloud services have implemented technical and organizational
security safeguards that can help our customers comply with the Argentine Personal
Data Protection Act (PDPA) 25.326. Microsoft also makes a data-transfer agreement
available to help with compliance with Provision 60-E/2016, which regulates the cross-
border transfer of personal data. This means that Microsoft customers can use Microsoft
Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 in a manner that complies with the
PDPA in Argentina.

The technical and organizational security measures implemented in the business cloud
services would also support other rules in the PDPA such as the prohibition of any
secondary use of a data subject's personal data and the prohibition against the transfer
of personal data to countries/regions that don't offer an adequate level of protection.



The Microsoft data-transfer agreement is an amendment (Amendment ID M314) to the
data processing terms in our Online Services Terms. It adds important commitments,
including that Microsoft notifies the customer of any legally binding request to disclose
personal data; will submit its data processing facilities to audit at the customer's request
either by the customer or an independent third party; and will get prior written consent
for the use of subcontractors.

Canada controlled goods
Article • 03/17/2025

Controlled goods are primarily goods, including components and technical data that
have military or national security significance, which are controlled domestically by the
Government of Canada and defined in the Defence Production Act . An overview of
controlled goods, how they're regulated, and the legal responsibilities associated with
them is available at What are controlled goods . Individuals and organizations must
register in the Controlled Goods Program (CGP) if they need to examine, possess, or
transfer controlled goods.

Controlled goods and cloud services
Many organizations registered in the CGP manage controlled goods technical data in
digital form and seek to apply the benefits of public cloud services for these workloads.
On May 16, 2024 the Controlled Goods Directorate (CGD) published updated Guidance
on using or providing cloud solutions for controlled goods data . The CGD cloud
guidance outlines the shared responsibility to safeguard controlled goods data between
a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and CGP registrants who might consider utilizing cloud
services.

Microsoft and controlled goods
Microsoft Canada Inc. is registered with the CGP for both traditional purposes, including
consulting services, and online cloud services. To view a directory of organizations
registered with the CGP, see: Find individuals and organizations registered in the
Controlled Goods Program .

While there's no compliance certification for controlled goods, Microsoft's CGP
registration includes an approved controlled goods security plan, describing alignment
with the CGD cloud guidance for in-scope services. This article details considerations for
CGP registrants when evaluating in-scope Microsoft Online Services for controlled
goods workloads.

Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services
Microsoft offers a broad portfolio of commercial cloud services globally. Given varying
product terms and capabilities and complex regulatory consideration, Microsoft



recommends that customers consider evaluating only the following services for
suitability to store and process controlled goods data:

Canada Region Azure Core Services are comprised of those Azure Core Online
Services identified in the Privacy & Security Terms in the Product Terms  that are
deployable within a Canada region (currently Canada Central or Canada East). To
see Azure Core Services available in Canadian regions, see: Azure Products
available by region .

Canada Region Office Core Services are Exchange Online, SharePoint Online,
OneDrive for Business, and Teams.

Any preview or prerelease versions of these services available to the customer for
optional use prior to their general availability isn't in scope for this guidance.

Canada Region Azure Core Services and Canada Region Office Core Services are part of
Microsoft's global cloud infrastructure. Some Canadian Defence Industrial Base
customers may also be eligible to access Microsoft's U.S. government cloud offerings .
Evaluation of these U.S.-based offerings in the context of controlled goods data is
beyond the scope of this article.

Controlled goods and Microsoft Cloud Services
The Microsoft Cloud is a globally deployed and standardized set of Online Services that
are available to customers to evaluate, procure, configure, and deploy to meet specific
business requirements. When the customer's cloud tenant is configured correctly, it
provides customers with enhanced flexibility, advanced capabilities, and improved
security over traditional on premises technology deployments. Microsoft designs its
Online Services so that Customer Data is secure and under the customer's control.
Microsoft is generally unable to customize how it delivers its Online Services offerings to
meet specific customer requirements.

Customers that choose to use cloud services bear ultimate responsibility for complying
with controlled goods regulatory obligations and safeguarding controlled goods data
that they choose to store in the cloud. Customer shared responsibility obligations
include:

Ensuring that their use of these services complies with applicable laws, including
laws governing examining, possessing, or transferring controlled goods.
Assessing whether a cloud service, including a feature or tool within a service, is
appropriate for handling relevant categories of controlled goods, including data
which might also be subject to controls under U.S. regulations such as the



International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). This can include evaluating the
adequacy of the cloud service provider's security responsibility safeguards, data
residency (storage at rest) commitments, location of data processing, location of
data transfers, third-party audits, and features or tools that might include human
review of Customer Data (such as the review of the output of some AI services to
prevent abuse).
Evaluating and applying cloud security features to restrict access to controlled
goods data that the customer stores in the cloud.
Ensuring that controlled goods data isn't included in headers, document names, or
file paths.
Implementing the customer's own security controls and other measures to manage
any residual risks relating to the unauthorized access to controlled goods data,
including by ensuring that access to controlled goods data isn't provided to
Microsoft personnel in a manner requiring them to examine, possess, or transfer
controlled goods data, unless the customer decides that the individual is approved
to examine controlled goods.

In the context of operating Online Services, Microsoft isn't in constructive possession of
controlled goods data. Microsoft personnel have no knowledge of the character of the
data that customers chooses to upload to its Online Services. Microsoft also has no
commercial means of understanding which of its customers are using or intending to
use its Online Services to store and process controlled goods data.

Alignment with controlled goods guidance for
cloud service providers
Online Services are standardized commercial off-the-shelf services that are provided to
customers pursuant to Microsoft's volume licensing agreement. This agreement includes
the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and the Microsoft
Product Terms (Product Terms).

Microsoft has designed and implemented the Canada Region Azure Core Services and
the Canada Region Office Core Services to comply with internationally recognized
security practices and policies. Many Microsoft Online Services have been assessed by
the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity through the Cloud service provider information
technology security assessment process (ITSM.50.100)  to the CCCS Medium Cloud
Security Profile. Additionally, Microsoft commits to implement and maintain technical
and organizational measures that comply with the requirements in ISO 27001, ISO
27002, and ISO 27018. In addition, each Canada Region Azure Core Service and Canada
Region Office Core Service (with limited, published exceptions) also complies with the



control standards and frameworks that form part of SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II and SSAE 18
SOC 2 Type II. For more information, see the DPA and the Privacy & Security Terms in
the Product Terms.

The CGD's security plan guidance  offers the following important definitions:

Access: To be in a position to examine, possess or transfer controlled goods.
Examine: To consider in detail or subject to an analysis in order to discover
essential features or meaning.
Possess: Either actual possession, where the person has direct physical control over
a controlled good at a given time, or constructive possession, where the person
has the power and the intention at a given time to exercise control over a
controlled good, directly or through another person or persons.
Transfer: With respect to a controlled good, to dispose of it or disclose its content
in any manner.

Having regard to the security controls and operational practices implemented for
Canada Region Azure Core Services and Canada Region Office Core Services, Microsoft's
understanding is that it doesn't access, examine, possess, or transfer controlled goods
data while providing such services or related technical support.

Technical support
Microsoft Online Services are designed so that Microsoft doesn't have visibility into how
or when a customer is using Online Services to store or process controlled goods data
(or any other type of data). Microsoft personnel don't have default standing access to
Customer Data in Online Services. In very limited support and engineering scenarios,
Microsoft support or engineering personnel might require access to Customer Data. For
those rare instances, Microsoft support or engineering personnel (who are typically
located outside Canada) can be granted access to Customer Data under management
oversight using temporary credentials via Just-in-Time (JIT) privileged access
management systems. Using the restricted access workflow, access to Customer Data is
carefully controlled, logged, and revoked when it's no longer needed. Even in these
scenarios, Microsoft won't know if controlled goods workloads are implicated.

Microsoft's globally deployed support and engineering personnel aren't security
assessed in accordance with the requirements of the Controlled Goods Regulations.
Because of this, it's the responsibility of the customer to determine what data to process
within Online Services or share with Microsoft during a support engagement. More
broadly, it's the customer's responsibility to ensure that its use of Online Services
doesn't result in these personnel examining controlled goods.



The CGP's guidance  defines the term "Examine" as considering data in detail or
subjecting it to an analysis to discover its essential features or meaning. This guidance
suggests that incidental exposure to data that is transient in nature and doesn't result in
considering it in detail or determining its essential meaning doesn't involve
"examination" of a controlled good.

As an additional defence in depth risk mitigation measure, Microsoft recommends
customers enable the Customer Lockbox feature with in-scope services. Customer
Lockbox puts the customer in control of support workflows that require access to
Customer Data by enabling the customer to approve or deny such elevated requests.
More information about Customer Lockbox:

Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Purview Customer Lockbox.

７ Note

In-scope Online Services generally support the Customer Lockbox feature with
some exceptions. It's the responsibility of the customer to consider this during their
evaluation of the suitability of Online Services for use with controlled goods
workloads.

Limited Canadian based support
There might be limited scenarios where examination or possession of controlled goods
is required to provide technical assistance during technology deployments or
troubleshooting. If detailed examination is required, the customer should request a
separate engagement with Microsoft Canada which includes an explicit contractual
commitment to ensure that personnel with a need to examine controlled goods data are
Canada-based and security assessed in accordance with the Controlled Goods
Regulations. It's the customer's responsibility to establish this custom agreement directly
with Microsoft Canada. Contact your Microsoft account team for more information.

Record keeping
Microsoft has no knowledge of the character or content of the data that customers
might store or process within Online Services and no ability to receive notifications from
customers related to the types of data they upload to Online Services. As a result,
Microsoft has no commercial means of tracking which of its customers are using or
intending to use its Online Services to store and process controlled goods data.



Recordkeeping obligations remain solely with the customer when they choose to use
Microsoft's Online Services.

Security incidents
Microsoft's security incident notification commitments for Online Services are
documented in the DPA. Microsoft personnel don't have knowledge of the nature of any
specific Customer Data that could have been affected by a security incident. It's the
responsibility of the customer (or CGP registrant) to determine whether a specific
security incident involved controlled goods data and report to the CGP as required in
section 10(h) of the Regulations .

Frequently asked questions
Where are Microsoft Online Services support and engineering personnel located?

Microsoft operates support services for its commercial cloud offerings in many locations
around the world to customers across different regions and countries.

What are the civic addresses of Microsoft's cloud datacenters in Canada?

Microsoft doesn't publicly disclose the civic addresses of its datacenters. We established
this policy to help secure our datacenter facilities. Microsoft currently operates two
cloud regions in Canada – Canada Central with sites located in Toronto and Canada East
with sites located in Quebec City. We recommend customers reference the cloud region
where their data is stored in place of physical addresses in their controlled goods
security plans if required.

Where is data stored in Microsoft Online Services?

Data residency refers to the cloud geography or region where Customer Data is stored
at rest. Use the following links to understand how you can determine current data
residency and data residency commitments for in scope services:

Microsoft 365 data residency overview
Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored
Data residency in Azure

Customers are responsible for evaluating whether a given cloud service enables data
residency configuration (including any exceptions identified in the Product Terms  or
the Microsoft Trust Center ). Not all Online Services allow for configuration of data
storage in specific cloud regions.



Where is data processed in Microsoft Online Services?

Data processing involves computing operations that cloud services perform on
Customer Data to provide required Online Services. It is the customer's responsibility to
evaluate whether processing, storing, or transferring data outside Canada can occur
within cloud services or as part of technical support and whether an export permit might
be required.

For Canada Region Azure Core Services, Microsoft won't store or process Customer Data
outside the customer-specified Geo without your authorization. Customers should
review Data residency in Azure – More information on customer data location  and
evaluate the following:

To maintain resiliency, Microsoft uses variable network paths that sometimes cross
Geo boundaries, but replication of Customer Data between regions is always
transmitted over encrypted network connections.
Microsoft personnel (including subprocessors) located outside the Geo can
remotely operate data processing systems in the Geo but won't access Customer
Data without authorization by the customer.
Certain services might not enable the customer to configure deployment in a
particular Azure Region or major geographic area (Geo) or might perform limited
processing or storage in other locations as detailed in the Microsoft Trust Center
(which Microsoft might update from time to time, but Microsoft won't add
exceptions for services no longer in Preview).
If a customer administrator or user takes an action in the services that initiates a
data transfer out of the Canadian Geo, Microsoft won't restrict such customer-
initiated transfers from happening; doing so would disrupt normal business
operations for the customer.

For Canada Region Office Core Services, data is typically processed closest to where the
data is stored, but some operations might process Customer Data in Azure commercial
cloud geographies outside of Canada. To see a complete list of these countries/regions,
see: Azure geographies .

What are the considerations with use of generative AI solutions with controlled
goods?

Microsoft's generative AI solutions, including Azure OpenAI Service and Copilot services
and capabilities, don't use your organization's data to train foundation models without
your permission. Your data isn't available to OpenAI or used to train OpenAI models.
Your data remains private when using Azure OpenAI Service and Copilots and is
governed by our applicable privacy and contractual commitments, including the



commitments we make in the Microsoft's Data Protection Addendum , Microsoft's
Product Terms , and the Microsoft Privacy Statement .  

With Microsoft's commitment to Responsible AI, Azure OpenAI services employ abuse
monitoring processes including human review to detect and mitigate instances of
recurring content and/or behaviors that suggest use of the service in a manner that
might violate the Code of Conduct or other applicable product terms. Customers should
evaluate how data is handled using the resources available at Azure OpenAI Data,
Privacy, and Security and how they can apply to obtain an exemption from abuse
monitoring and human review.

For more information on Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft
365, see: Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

What export authorizations are required when using controlled goods with Microsoft
Online Services?

Customers should seek guidance from Global Affairs Canada (or other regulators)
regarding any export authorizations that can be required when evaluating Microsoft
Canada Region Azure Core Services and Canada Region Office Core Services, including
but not limited to scenarios where data storage, network data in transit, data processing,
or transfers can occur outside of Canada.

Microsoft does not accept liability or responsibility for being added as a party to any
export license application without our express consent. For more information, see the
Microsoft Exporting FAQ .

What other security and privacy features can be useful when configuring an in-scope
Online Service for use with controlled goods?

It's the customer's responsibility to ensure that its use of Online Services doesn't result
in unauthorized individuals, including Microsoft Online Services personnel, examining,
possessing, or transferring controlled goods. This can involve, for example, the
Customer evaluating and adopting security features available within specific Online
Services. Relevant features include:

Customer Lockbox: Microsoft recommends customers enable the Customer
Lockbox feature with in-scope services as an additional defence in depth risk
mitigation measure. Customer Lockbox puts the customer in control of support
workflows that require access to Customer Data by enabling the customer to
approve or deny such elevated requests. For more information about Customer
Lockbox, see:

Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Purview Customer Lockbox.



Microsoft Purview Information Protection: Sensitivity labels from Microsoft
Purview Information Protection let you classify and protect your organization's
data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't
hindered. Microsoft recommends customers deploy and configure appropriate
sensitivity labels and associated data protection policies for controlled goods data
in Office Core Services.
Microsoft Purview Double Key Encryption (DKE): Office Apps (Outlook, Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint on Windows) support the use of Double Key Encryption,
providing an end-to-end encryption configuration option. Office documents and
the body of emails are encrypted by the Office client applications using a key
management service and key that is under the customer's control. Where content
is encrypted using DKE, the overall functionality of Microsoft 365 Core Services,
including many customer-configured security features, can be reduced since the
Microsoft cloud infrastructure doesn't have access to your private key and can't
perform cloud processing on the encrypted data. For example, this limits some
functionality such as cloud-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP), use of Office Web
Apps and coauthoring. By extension, customer data encrypted with DKE in the
cloud is never accessible in unencrypted form to Microsoft support or engineering
personnel. DKE must be deployed with Microsoft Purview Information Protection
for service encryption and use of sensitivity labels on content.
Azure Confidential Computing: Confidential computing on Azure enhances
security across various aspects of the compute cloud infrastructure and adheres to
the industry's definition of confidential computing . While existing encryption
protects data at rest and data in transit, confidential computing protects or
encrypts data while in use during processing or computation in memory using new
hardware-based trusted execution environments in Azure. Azure's confidential
computing offerings go beyond operational safeguards and memory protection, to
provide workload isolation with hardware-rooted trust. The confidential computing
threat model aims to remove or reduce the ability for a cloud provider operator
and other actors in the tenant's domain to access code and data while it's being
executed. When used with data encryption at rest and in transit, confidential
computing eliminates the single largest barrier of encryption - encryption while in
use - by protecting sensitive or highly regulated data sets and application
workloads in a secure public cloud platform.
Azure Key Vault: Azure Key Vault Managed HSM (Hardware Security Module) is a
fully managed, highly available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service
that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys for your cloud applications,
using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. It's one of several key management
solutions in Azure.

What are the considerations related to Office Connected Services?



Microsoft Office consists of client software applications and Connected Experiences
designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively.
Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a
Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. Some
Connected Experiences, known as Optional Connected Experiences, that can be
accessed when using the Office Apps reach out to the internet (or to other Microsoft
Online Services) to perform their function.

Some Office Connected Experiences analyze customer content in Office Apps to provide
you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar
features. Analyzing content in this manner is another form of data processing and can
occur in Azure commercial cloud geographies outside of Canada.

Customers should include Office Connected Experiences as part of their evaluation of
controlled goods and Microsoft Online Services including the ability to control use of
experiences that analyze content for documents that have specific sensitivity labels
applied.

What are the common limitations of end-to-end encryption with cloud services?

End-to-end encryption, or E2EE, typically implies that content is encrypted before it's
sent to the cloud and decrypted only by the intended recipient when it's received from
the cloud. With E2EE, only the two endpoint systems are involved in encrypting and
decrypting the data. If the cloud services infrastructure doesn't have controlled access to
the encryption key to decrypt the data, the ability to perform processing of that data is
limited. For example, cloud-based malware scanning, enforcing cloud-based Data Loss
Prevention (DLP) rules on content, and multi-user document editing wouldn't function if
the cloud services provider couldn't decrypt the data to perform the required
processing.

Microsoft Double Key Encryption provides an end-to-end encryption configuration
option intended for use with a subset of Office 365 data that is subject to the strictest
data protection requirements. Deployment requirements need to be reviewed carefully
when evaluating this capability.

７ Note

The end-to-end encryption term can have other interpretations including in the
context of a defined security boundary. It's the customer's responsibility to evaluate
and configure encryption options available within Online Services.



What resources are available to help implement a secure cloud configuration that
enforces my organizational security policies?

Microsoft publishes extensive information on how to architect, configure, and operate
secure cloud tenant configurations. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure
provides a helpful starting point for IaaS and PaaS workloads. The Zero Trust
deployment plan with Microsoft 365 provides guidance on building Zero Trust security
with Microsoft 365.

What if controlled goods data is also subject to other export control regulations?

Customers are responsible for determining whether Microsoft services (including Online
Services, technical support, and professional services) are appropriate for storage or
processing of information subject to any specific law or regulation and for using the
Microsoft services in a manner consistent with legal and regulatory obligations.
Although scenarios involving controlled goods data that is subject to non-Canadian
export control regulations are outside the scope of this article, the information in the
Resources section might be helpful to customers.

Canada privacy laws
Article • 10/19/2022

Canada privacy laws overview
Canadian privacy laws were established to protect the privacy of individuals and give
them the right to access information gathered about them. The laws require
organizations to take reasonable steps to safeguard information in their custody or
control. They apply to personal information that is held and processed by governments
and private organizations.

Federal privacy laws
Canada has two federal privacy laws that are enforced by the Office of the Privacy
Commissioner of Canada  (OPCC):

The Privacy Act  regulates how federal government organizations collect, use,
and disclose personal information, including personal information of federal
employees. It applies only to federal government institutions listed in the Privacy
Act Schedule of Institutions.
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act  (PIPEDA)
governs how private-sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal
information related to business activities of commercial for-profit enterprises and
for the employees of federally regulated businesses like banks, airlines, and
telecommunications companies.

PIPEDA is founded on 10 fair information principles  that businesses must follow if
they are to comply with the law. For example, the basic principle of consent gives rise to
the PIPEDA requirement that organizations must obtain an individual's permission to
collect or use their personal information. Individuals have the right to both access that
personal information and challenge its accuracy, grounded in the principle of individual
access. The principle of identifying purposes leads to the rule that personal information
can be used only for the purposes agreed upon.

Provincial privacy laws
In general, PIPEDA applies to commercial activities in all provinces and territories, except
those operating entirely within provinces with their own privacy laws  that have been
declared substantially similar to the federal law. For example, Alberta, British Columbia,



and Québec have private sector privacy legislation deemed substantively similar to
PIPEDA, and as a result, the provincial laws are followed there in place of the federal
legislation. Moreover, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and
Ontario have health-related privacy laws that have been declared substantially similar to
PIPEDA with respect to health information. These laws apply to personal health
information within the respective provinces.

Alberta: The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta  enforces the
Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), which provides individuals with the
right to request access to their own personal information while providing private
sector organizations with a framework for conducting the collection, use, and
disclosure of personal information.
British Columbia: The Information & Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia
enforces the following legislation:

Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) sets out the
access and privacy rights of individuals as they relate to the public sector.
Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) applies to private-sector
organizations that collect, use, and disclose the personal information of
individuals in British Columbia.

Québec: The Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec  enforces the Act
respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector , which
establishes rules for the collection, use, and communication of personal
information in the course of business activities.
New Brunswick: The Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act
(PHIPAA) establishes rules that protects the confidentiality of personal health
information and the privacy of the individual to whom that information relates.
Newfoundland and Labrador: The Personal Health Information Act  (PHIA)
establishes rules that custodians of personal health information must follow when
collecting, using, and disclosing individuals’ confidential personal health
information.
Nova Scotia: The Personal Health Information Act  (PHIA) governs the collection,
use, disclosure, retention, disposal, and destruction of personal health information.
Ontario: The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act  (FIPPA)
establishes a general right of access to recorded information in the custody or
control of institutions subject to the legislation and protects the privacy of
individuals regarding their personal information in the custody or under control of
those institutions. Moreover, the Personal Health Information Protection Act
(PHIPA) establishes rules for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health
information.



Azure and Canada privacy laws
There is no formal certification that cloud service providers can use to comply with
Canadian privacy laws. However, Azure provides you with:

Strong privacy assurances  about controlling your data, where your data is
located, securing your data, and defending your data.
Privacy-related contractual commitments regarding data residency, security,
access, breach notification, and so on, as stated in the Microsoft Products and
Services Data Protection Addendum  (DPA).
Ability to maintain ownership of customer data—the content, personal data, and
other data you provide for storing and hosting in Azure services. Microsoft won't
store or process your customer data outside the geography you specify , except
for certain non-regional services.
Relevant formal audits conducted in accordance with established standards such as
ISO 27001, ISO 27018, ISO 27701, SOC 2 Type 2, and others.
Technical features such as data encryption in transit and at rest, resource
monitoring, security alerting, and so on, to help you enable data protection and
meet your privacy requirements.
Guidance documentation, including privacy implications on Microsoft cloud
services  that covers Canada among many other countries.
Azure foundational privacy impact assessment (PIA), is available from the Service
Trust Portal (STP) Privacy and Data Protection  section. The Azure PIA provides a
third-party analysis of how Microsoft Azure complies with the Canadian Privacy
Act, PIPEDA, FIPPA (Ontario), PHIPA (Ontario), CSA Code (Private Sector), Québec
Private Sector Law, and ISO/IEC 27018.
Additional cloud services privacy documentation is available from the STP Canada
regional resources  section.

If you're considering outsourcing business functions to the cloud, Microsoft has

To support public and private sector organizations that are concerned about data
residency, Microsoft has established two Canadian data centers in Toronto and Québec



City. These data centers add in-country data residency , failover, and disaster recovery
for your customer data and applications.

According to the Microsoft Product Terms  (formerly Online Services Terms) and the
Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum  (DPA), the responsibility
and ownership of personal data lies with you. However, Microsoft has assessed its
practices in risk, security, and incident management; access control; data integrity
protection; and other areas relative to the recommendations from the Office of the
Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Based on that assessment, we have determined that
in-scope Azure services can meet those recommendations and help you meet the
requirements of Canadian privacy laws.

How to implement
Privacy in Microsoft cloud services : Get details on Microsoft privacy principles
and standards and on privacy laws specific to Canada.
Compliance checklist for financial institutions in Canada : Learn more about
Azure features that can help you meet Canadian privacy laws.
Azure foundational privacy impact assessment  (PIA) for Canada: Third-party

(Ontario), PHIPA (Ontario), CSA Code (Private Sector), Québec Private Sector Law,
and ISO/IEC 27018.
Azure data protection: Azure provides you with strong data security, both by
default and as customer options.
Business continuity and disaster recovery : Learn how to use Azure to recover
your business services in a timely manner in the case of service disruption or
accidental data deletion.

Frequently asked questions
As an Azure customer, how can I comply with PIPEDA and other Canadian privacy
laws?
Microsoft states in the Microsoft Product Terms  (formerly Online Services Terms) that
it complies with laws and regulations that apply to its provision of Microsoft online
services. However, organizations that use Microsoft online services including Azure are



wholly responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to them,
including Canadian privacy laws.

As a result, privacy is a shared responsibility between Microsoft as a cloud service
provider and you as the customer using cloud services. At a high level, this requirement
means that you must ensure that your solutions implemented on Azure address the 10
PIPEDA fair information principles . For example, you're responsible for getting the
consent of individuals to collect their personal data and safeguarding it with adequate
security measures. Microsoft doesn't inspect, approve, or monitor your applications
deployed on Azure.

What third-party audits validate Azure security controls?
Azure undergoes formal audits conducted in accordance with established standards
such as ISO 27001, ISO 27018, ISO 27701, SOC 2 Type 2, and others. Compliance with
these standards is verified by third-party auditors who provide independent validation
that security controls are in place and operating effectively. You can access audit reports
and certificates from the Service Trust Portal  (STP). You must sign in to access audit
reports on the STP. You must have an existing Azure subscription or free Azure trial
account  to sign in. For more information, see Get started with Microsoft Service Trust
Portal .

Will I know the physical location where my data is stored?
Yes, you'll always know where you customer data is stored at rest . Microsoft provides
strong customer commitments about data residency in the Microsoft Products and
Services Data Protection Addendum  (DPA), and explains how data residency
commitments apply to Azure regional vs. non-regional services . No matter where your
customer data is located, Microsoft doesn't control or limit the locations from which you
or your end users may access customer data.

PIPEDA doesn’t require Canadian businesses to keep personal information in Canada.
However, depending on the province where organizations do business, or their industry,
they could be required to keep certain types of data within Canadian borders. To help
address these types of requirements, Microsoft has established two Canadian data
centers in Toronto and Quebec City. The physical infrastructure at Canadian data centers
is in scope for Azure formal third-party audits mentioned previously.

Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity
(CCCS) Medium
Article • 03/14/2025

CCCS Medium overview
The Government of Canada (GC) Protected B security level for sensitive government
information and assets  applies to information or assets that, if compromised, could
cause serious injury to an individual, organization, or government. Based on the
Information Technology Security Guidance (ITSG) 33 on IT security risk management
published by the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity  (CCCS), GC developed
the Guidance on the Security Categorization of Cloud-Based Services (ITSP.50.103)  and
the Government of Canada Security Control Profile for Cloud-based GC Services  (GC
Security Control Profile), which identifies the baseline security controls applicable to the
processing of information having a security category of Protected B, medium integrity,
and medium availability (PBMM). The original PBMM security control profile evolved
into what is now the CCCS Medium Cloud Profile Recommendations .

The GC Security Control Profile was developed using the ITSG-33 and the US Federal
Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), both of which have a
foundation in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  Special
Publication (SP) 800-53  security and privacy controls. GC has aligned the GC Security
Control Profile with FedRAMP to maximize both the interoperability of cloud services
and reusability of the authorization evidence produced by cloud service providers
(CSPs).

The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat  (TBS) is responsible for GC enterprise
governance, strategy, and policy for cloud services, including maintaining oversight and
monitoring departmental compliance with the GC Cloud Guardrails as mandated under
the Directive on Service and Digital. GC has evolved its Cloud Adoption Strategy, now
advocating a cloud-smart principle  in which cloud is the preferred option for new
applications and will rationalize existing application portfolios to align to the most
appropriate hosting model.

The Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity (CCCS) has established a Cloud Service Provider
Security Assessment Process  that reviews a CSP’s ability implement the CCCS Medium
security controls (Note: the CCCS Medium control profile superseded the original
Government of Canada Security Control Profile for Cloud-based GC Services ). The
resulting technical risk assessment report contains the results from the review process.



Departmental Guidance on Cloud Security Assessment and Authorization
(ITSP.50.105)  is also available from CCCS.

Microsoft in-scope cloud platforms & services
The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security conducts assessments where the security
controls and processes of cloud service providers are evaluated against the Government
of Canada security requirements for information and services up to Protected B, medium
integrity, medium availability (PBMM) according to the CCCS Medium security control
profile . To date CCCS has formally assessed the following Microsoft online services:

Azure
Dynamics 365
Power Platform
Microsoft 365

Azure, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and
CCCS Medium
Microsoft was one of the first global cloud service providers to be qualified for
Government of Canada secure cloud services when it entered into a framework
agreement with the federal government in 2019. The framework agreement supports
the Canadian Government’s ambitions to streamline government processes and is a key
step on the road towards a true digital Government. Microsoft’s Azure CCCS Medium
assessed services unleash new opportunities for public sector innovation,
transformation, and service agility as public servants gain access to a range of
sophisticated capabilities that support storage and processing of Protected B data. In
addition, government agencies benefit from Microsoft’s thriving ecosystem of partners
and developers who build innovative and secure solutions on Azure.

Microsoft has established two Canadian Azure cloud regions: Canada Central in Toronto
and Canada East in Québec City each consisting of multiple hyperscale cloud datacenter
sites. These regions add Canadian in-country data residency for storage of Customer
Data at rest , failover, and disaster recovery  for applications and Customer Data for
many Core Online Services. Additional datacenter infrastructure investments in the
Canada Central Region have also enabled an Azure Availability Zone within the Canada
Central region to help customers create even more resilient and highly available
applications for mission-critical workloads.

For a complete listing of in-scope CCCS assessed cloud services across Azure, Dynamics
365 and Power Platform, please see the summary assessment reports in the Canada



regional section of the Service Trust Portal .

Office 365 and CCCS Medium

Office 365 environments
Microsoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated
experience of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide.
Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their customer
data is located. Microsoft may replicate customer data to other regions within the same
geographic area (for example, the United States) for data resiliency, but Microsoft will
not replicate customer data outside the chosen geographic area.

This section covers the following Office 365 environments:

Client software (Client): commercial client software running on customer devices.
Office 365 (Commercial): the commercial public Office 365 cloud service available
globally.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC): the Office 365 GCC cloud
service is available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments,
and contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud - High (GCC High): the Office 365 GCC
High cloud service is designed according to Department of Defense (DoD) Security
Requirements Guidelines Level 4 controls and supports strictly regulated federal
and defense information. This environment is used by federal agencies, the
Defense Industrial Base (DIBs), and government contractors.
Office 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to
DoD Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal
and defense regulations. This environment is for the exclusive use by the US
Department of Defense.

Use this section to help meet your compliance obligations across regulated industries
and global markets. To find out which services are available in which regions, see the
International availability information  and the Where your Microsoft 365 customer data
is stored article. For more information about Office 365 Government cloud environment,
see the Office 365 Government Cloud article.

Your organization is wholly responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations. Information provided in this section does not constitute legal advice
and you should consult legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory
compliance for your organization.

Assessment reports
The summary CCCS assessment reports for Microsoft services are available to customers
in the Canada regional section of the Service Trust Portal . The detailed security
assessment reports for Microsoft services are available to Canadian government
customers by contacting the CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca.

Frequently asked questions
Which Microsoft cloud services are available to the Government of Canada through
the Shared Services Canada cloud contract?

One of the first global cloud providers to be awarded a Cloud Framework Agreement by
the Government of Canada, Microsoft offers a range of commercial cloud services –
including Azure, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365. The Shared Services
Canada cloud broker catalog provides details on the Microsoft cloud services that are
currently available to GC departments.

What level of US FedRAMP compliance do Microsoft’s cloud services conform to and
how does this apply to Canadian cloud regions?

Microsoft Azure commercial (including Dynamics 365) maintain a FedRAMP High
Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATOs). Microsoft 365 commercial maintains a
FedRAMP High equivalency. Azure regions outside the United States aren't formally
authorized by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and aren't in the FedRAMP



High P-ATO scope. However, Azure security controls and operational processes are
consistent everywhere Azure runs. FedRAMP is based on the NIST SP 800-53 control
baselines. All NIST SP 800-53 controls that support the Azure FedRAMP High P-ATO in
the United States are also operational in other Azure regions outside the United States.
Therefore, Azure customers outside the United States can count on the same control
implementation details that pertain to the NIST SP 800-53 High control baseline. See
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for more details.
FedRAMP audit evidence is available in the Service Trust Portal .

Are there geographic restrictions on where Protected B data must be stored?

The Government of Canada has developed a flexible data residency (storage of data at
rest) policy for the storage of Protected B data as per Section 4.4.3.14 of the Directive
on Service and Digital . This is further clarified in Section 4.4 of the Guideline on
Service and Digital . Canadian data residency needs to be identified and evaluated as a
principal delivery option for storage of Protected B data in the cloud, however the
departmental CIO (or in some cases the CIO of Canada), has the flexibility and is
responsible for approving decisions to store data outside of Canada based on the
following business criteria identified in Section 4.4.3 Considerations in implementing the
requirement:

Reputation
Legal and contractual considerations
Trade agreements
Market availability
Business value
Technical capabilities

Microsoft security controls and processes are implemented consistently in all cloud
regions globally. While controls within the CCCS Medium profile may reference the GC
data residency policy, evaluation of location of data at rest doesn't factor into the risk
rating of a CCCS cloud assessment report.

Section 4.4.2 (Why is this important?) also clarifies that encrypted data in transit is not
restricted by the data residency requirement.

The following resources provide information about data residency for many common
products and services:

Microsoft 365 Defender data security and privacy

What are Nonregional cloud services?

Azure nonregional services are services that have no dependency on a specific Azure
region and don't currently provide customers with the ability to specify a deployment
region. These services were architected and optimized to be always available as part of
Azure's global cloud. An example of a nonregional service is Azure Active Directory. You
can find a complete list at Azure Products by Region .

Where does data processing in the cloud take place?

Many Azure services enable you to specify the region where your Customer Data will be
stored and processed. For more information, see Data Residency in Azure . SaaS online
services such as Microsoft 365 typically process data closest to where the data is stored
however processing of Customer Data might occur in cloud regions outside of Canada.
The delivery of support services might also involve processing of data outside Canada.

Resources
Microsoft has developed several resources to assist customers when deploying cloud
services suitable for running Protected B workloads including:

Azure Landing Zone for Canada Public Sector : a purpose-built reference
implementation to guide government departments in their efforts to comply with
CCCS Medium requirements that are the customer’s responsibility.
Canada Federal PBMM Azure Blueprint: a set of repeatable Azure resources and
patterns that allow organizations to build new cloud environments with
compliance to specific CCCS Medium controls and GC Cloud Guardrails.
Foundational Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) : The Foundational PIAs are
intended to better inform privacy leaders, practitioners, and risk managers, who
might consider using this analysis as the core for their own PIA work during the
adoption of Microsoft’s cloud-based service offerings.

Australian Government Information
Security Registered Assessor Program
(IRAP)
Article • 01/31/2024

The Information Security Registered Assessor Program (IRAP) provides a comprehensive
process for the independent assessment of a system's security against Australian
government policies and guidelines. The IRAP goal is to maximize the security of
Australian federal, state, and local government data by focusing on the information and
communications technology infrastructure that stores, processes, and communicates it.

IRAP overview
The Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) is governed and
administered by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). IRAP provides the
framework to endorse individuals from the private and public sectors to provide cyber
security assessment services to the Australian government. Endorsed IRAP assessors can
provide an independent assessment of ICT security, suggest mitigations and highlight
residual risks. IRAP provides a comprehensive process for the independent assessment
of a system's security against Australian government policies and guidelines. The IRAP
goal is to maximize the security of Australian federal, state, and local government data
by focusing on the information and communications technology infrastructure that
stores, processes, and communicates it.

In 2014, Azure was launched as the first IRAP-assessed cloud service in Australia,
hosted from datacenters in Melbourne and Sydney. These two datacenters give
Australian customers control over where their customer data is stored, while also
providing enhanced data durability in there are disasters through backups at both
locations.
In early 2015, Office 365 became the first cloud productivity service to complete
this assessment.
In April 2015, the ASD announced the CCSL certification of both Azure and Office
365, and in November 2015, of Dynamics 365.
In June 2017, ASD announced the recertification of Microsoft Azure and Office 365
for a greatly expanded set of services.
In April 2018, the ACSC announced the certification of Azure and Office 365 at the
PROTECTED classification. Microsoft is the first and only public cloud provider to
achieve this level of certification.



In September 2019, Microsoft's updated IRAP assessment scope expanded to
include 113 services at the PROTECTED classification.
In December 2020, Microsoft released two incremental IRAP assessments for Azure
and Office 365. These reports utilized the new guidance post the cessation of the
Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL). The reports contain both an assessment of
Microsoft as a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and other services that are incremental
to the 2019 reports across Azure, Dynamics, and Office 365.

Microsoft and IRAP
In December 2020, Microsoft completed two incremental Azure & Dynamics and Office
365 assessments. These assessments added more services assessed to the classification
level of PROTECTED. Moreover, these assessments were conducted under the new, post
CCSL Cloud Security Guidance as outlined in the Anatomy of a Cloud Assessment and
Authorisation guidance  from the ACSC.

For each assessment, Microsoft engaged an ACSC-accredited IRAP assessor who
examined the security controls and processes used by Microsoft's IT operations team,
physical datacenters, intrusion detection, cryptography, cross-domain and network
security, access control, and information security risk management of in-scope services.
The IRAP assessments found that the Microsoft system architecture is based on sound
security principles, and that the applicable Australian Government Information Security
Manual (ISM) controls are in place and fully effective within our assessed services.

The risk management framework used by the ISM draws from National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37 Rev. 2 . Within this
risk management framework, the identification of risks and selection of security controls
can be undertaken using various risk management standards, such as International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000:2018, Risk management - Guidelines .
Broadly, the risk management framework used by the ISM has six steps:

Define the system
Select security controls
Implement security controls
Assess security controls
Authorize the system
Monitor the system

As always, additional compensating controls can be implemented on a risk-managed
basis by individual agencies prior to agency authorization and subsequent use of these
cloud services.



The IRAP assessment of Microsoft's services and cloud operations helps provide
assurance to public sector customers in government and their partners that Microsoft
has appropriate and effective security controls in place for the processing, storage, and
transmission of data classified up to and including the level of PROTECTED. This
assessment includes most government, healthcare, and education data in Australia.

cloud services. New Zealand government agencies require compliance with a standard
similar to the Australian Government ISM, so they may also use the IRAP assessments.

Can I use Microsoft's compliance in my organization's risk assessment and approval
process?



Yes. If your organization requires or is seeking an approval to operate in line with the
ISM, you can use the IRAP security assessments of Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft
Managed Desktop, and Office 365 in your risk assessment. You are, however, responsible
for engaging an assessor to evaluate your implementation as deployed on Microsoft's
platforms, and for the controls and processes within your own organization.

Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology (MeitY)
Article • 05/01/2023

MeitY overview
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), an agency of the
government of India, provides policy guidelines to all government and state public
sector organizations. Its guidelines are also frequently adopted by private sector
organizations in regulated industries, like financial services and telecommunications.

MeitY provides accreditation (referred to by MeitY as 'empanelment') of cloud service
providers, which requires that cloud services be certified as compliant against a
predefined set of standards and guidelines on security, interoperability, data portability,
service level agreement, and contractual terms and conditions. Auditors accredited by
MeitY verify compliance by conducting audits of cloud service providers.

Once accredited, cloud service providers are listed in a government cloud services
directory where public sector organizations can compare and procure accredited cloud
services. The directory is a service of the MeghRaj Cloud Initiative  (or GI [Government
of India] Cloud), which promotes the use of cloud computing in government, and
governs the implementation of public sector IT services.

Microsoft and Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology (MeitY)
In November 2017, Microsoft became one of the first global cloud service providers to
achieve full accreditation by MeitY for its three cloud models:

Public Cloud, for shared, multi-tenant public cloud services
Government Virtual Private Cloud, which must be logically separate from the public
and other offerings of the cloud service provider

The MeitY accreditation of Microsoft was the result of a rigorous audit conducted by the
Standardization Testing and Quality Certification (STQC) Directorate, a government
organization that provides quality assurance services, using an evaluation framework
based on the work of the MeghRaj Cloud Initiative. Through Microsoft Azure, public
sector organizations can now draw on a wide range of deployment models and service



offerings, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), disaster
recovery, DevOps, and managed backup.

My Number Act (Japan)
Article • 03/14/2025

About the My Number Act
The Japanese government enacted the My Number Act (Japanese  and English ),
which took effect in January 2016. It assigned a unique 12-digit number, called My
Number, or the Social Benefits and Tax Number or Individual Number, to every resident
of Japan, whether Japanese or foreign. Giving each person one number for all purposes
(like the US Social Security number) was designed to simplify and make more efficient
taxation and the implementation of social benefits such as the national pension, medical
insurance, and unemployment.

The Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC), which acts as the centralized
data protection authority, was established by the Act on the Protection of Personal
Information (Japanese  and English ). In the PPC's role of supervising and monitoring
compliance with the My Number Act, it has issued My Number Guidelines  (Japanese)
to ensure that organizations properly handle and adequately protect personal data,
including My Number data, as required by law.

Microsoft and the My Number Act
To help our Japanese customers protect the privacy of personal data, Microsoft
contractually commits through the Microsoft Online Services Terms  that our in-scope
business cloud services have implemented the technical and organizational security
safeguards that help our customers comply with the My Number Act. This support
means that customers in Japan can deploy Microsoft business cloud services with the
confidence that they can comply with Japanese legislative requirements.

The Q&A  (Japanese) published by the Personal Information Protection Commission
(PPC) sets forth guidelines for the appropriate handling and protection of personal
information. It provides that a third party isn't construed as handling personal data if the
third party stipulates in its agreement that (a) it doesn't do so, and (b) it establishes a
proper access control system. The My Number Act specifies obligations when data is
transferred to a third party, but section Q3-12  (Japanese) of the PPC Q&A explains
that these requirements don't apply if the third party doesn't 'handle', that is, have
standing access to personal data.

Microsoft business cloud services address those requirements in the Microsoft Online
Services Terms , which stipulate that the ownership of and responsibility for customer



data that contains My Number data lie with our customers, not Microsoft. The customer,
therefore, must have appropriate controls in place to protect My Number data
contained in customer data.

Because Microsoft doesn't have standing access to My Number data stored in its cloud
services, an 'outsourcing' contract for handling My Number data isn't required. If a
customer wants Microsoft to access customer data that contains My Number data, the
customer must create another outsourcing contract with Microsoft for every case before
making such a request.

The terms also state that Microsoft commits to use customer data only to provide
services to the customer—not for any advertising or similar commercial purposes, and
that Microsoft has robust access control systems in place.

Therefore, Microsoft business cloud services support My Number Act requirements and
don't create any other obligations under the act for customers, such as consent from an
individual owner of personal data.

Korea K-ISMS
Article • 02/24/2023

Overview
Under Article 47 in the “Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network
Utilization and Information Protection”, the Korean government introduced the Korea-
Information Security Management System  (K-ISMS). A country-specific ISMS
framework, it defines a stringent set of control requirements designed to help ensure
that organizations in Korea consistently and securely protect their information assets.

To obtain the certification, a company must undergo an assessment by an independent
auditor that covers both information security management and security
countermeasures. It covers 104 criteria including 12 control items in 5 sectors for
information security management, and 92 control items in 13 sectors for information
security countermeasures. Some of these criteria include examination of the
organization’s security management responsibilities, security policies, security training,
incident response, risk management, and more. A special committee examines the
results of the audit and grants the certification.

The K-ISMS framework is built on successful information security strategies and policies.
It also accounts for security countermeasures and threat response procedures to
minimize the impact of security breaches. These procedures have a significant overlap
with ISO/IEC 27001 control objectives but are not identical. K-ISMS provides a more
detailed investigation against requirements than a general ISO/IEC 27001 assessment.

Under the supervision of the Korean Ministry of Science and Information Technology
(MSIT), the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA)  is the K-ISMS certifying authority.
Certification is valid for three years, and certified entities must pass an annual audit to
maintain it.

ISMS-P certification system
In November 2018, the MSIT, Korea Communications Commission, and Ministry of the
Interior and Safety merged the K-ISMS and the Korea-Personal Information
Management System (K-PIMS) into a new certification system, Personal Information and
Information Security Management System  (ISMS-P).

The integration of these two systems reflects the recent trends in the integration of
information security and the protection of personal information. The goal was both to



strengthen the links between these systems and to reduce the compliance burden on
organizations due to the considerable overlap of requirements. Instead of 104 K-ISMS
controls and 82 K-PIMS controls, the new consolidated certification has 80 controls
related to information security and 22 controls related to the protection of personal
information.

Azure and K-ISMS
Based on a rigorous evaluation by KISA, Microsoft Azure achieved the K-ISMS
certification based on the new ISMS-P certification system. This certification applies to
the datacenter infrastructure of the Microsoft Korea Central and Korea South regions. It
covers Azure services that encompass compute, storage, networking, databases, and
security. The specifications for K-ISMS certification are based on ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC
27018, and other international standards that govern information security.

Achieving the K-ISMS certification means that Azure customers in Korea can more easily
demonstrate adherence to local legal requirements to protect key digital information
assets and meet KISA compliance standards. Moreover, Korean organizations that have
a legislated mandate to obtain their own K-ISMS certification — certain internet and
information network service providers, large hospitals and schools, and so on — can
more efficiently meet their own K-ISMS compliance requirements by building on the
Azure certification.

The audit covered the measures Microsoft takes to secure data and protect its
confidentiality including:

Certification of Microsoft business cloud services according to ISO/IEC 27001.
High level of privacy protection based on Microsoft compliance with ISO/IEC
27018.
Layered approach in how Microsoft datacenters are designed, built, and operated
to enable strict control of physical access to the areas where customer data is
stored.

The Azure K-ISMS certification covers 80 controls for information security based on the
new ISMS-P certification system. It is effective for three years from the certification date
with an annual reassessment by KISA, the certifying body.

Frequently asked questions
Who must obtain the K-ISMS certification?
There are voluntary and compulsory subjects. Voluntary subjects, like Microsoft, apply
for K-ISMS certification if they wish. However, KISA mandates certification for
compulsory subjects that include:

Internet service providers that are authorized by Article 6, Section 1 of the
Telecommunication Business Act and provide information network services in
Seoul and all metropolitan areas.
Internet datacenters designated as an “integrated information and communication
facilities” by Article 46 in the Act on Promotion of Information and
Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection.
Any organization that meets these conditions:

Hospitals categorized as a “higher general hospital” in Article 3, Section 4 of the
Medical Service Act whose annual sales or tax revenue is at least $150 million
(USD).
Schools, per Article 2 in the Higher Education Act, where the number of enrolled
students is at least 10,000 as of December 31 of the immediately preceding
year.
Information network service providers whose sales of information and
communication services are at least $10 million (USD) or an average of at least 1
million users per day in the previous three months; excluding, however, a
financial company under subparagraph 3 of Article 2 of the Electronic Financial
Transactions Act.

How does the integration of the K-ISMS and K-PIMS impact the Microsoft
certification?
Cloud service providers such as Microsoft can apply for an audit under the new ISMS-P
certification system. Organizations can apply for the K-ISMS certification based on the
80 controls for information security, or they can apply for the ISMS-P by complying with



the 22 additional requirements for personal information protection. Microsoft's latest K-
ISMS certification covers 80 controls for information security based on the new ISMS-P
certification system.

New Zealand Government Information
Security and Privacy Considerations
Article • 07/03/2024

In April 2023, the New Zealand government agreed to a refreshed cloud first policy .
This policy and previous decisions require New Zealand government organizations to
take the following actions before using public cloud services:

Move away from on-premises systems and infrastructure
Safely store information
Have and use a cloud plan
Consider Te Ao Māori perspectives
Adopt sustainability principles
Assess the risks

The New Zealand government requires that certain organizations comply with the New
Zealand Government Information Security and Privacy Considerations. This requirement
applies to organizations that fall under the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO)
mandate, including the public and nonpublic service departments, Te Whatu Ora Health
New Zealand, Te Aka Whai Ora Māori Health Authority, and Crown entities. These
organizations must adhere to the framework when they're deciding on the use of a
cloud service. Several questions in the framework relate to the Privacy Act 2020.
Microsoft's responses to these questions are based on the New Zealand Privacy Act
2020 where applicable.

They also published a set of guidelines for agencies on how to adopt cloud services. This
framework includes the following steps:

Classify information properly
Know the benefits of using public cloud services
Use your organization’s cloud plan
See how to buy public cloud services
Use the risk discovery tool
Use your organization’s process for assessing risks

The New Zealand government expects all State Service agencies to work within this
framework when assessing and adopting cloud services. Requirements for Cloud
Computing  outlines what agencies must do when adopting cloud services along with
an overview of the history of the government's cloud policy.



Required risk assessment
To assist New Zealand government agencies in conducting consistent and robust due
diligence on potential cloud solutions, the GCIO published the Risk Discovery Tool for
Public Cloud Services . This tool contains around 100 questions focused on data
sovereignty, privacy, security, governance, confidentiality, data integrity, availability, and
incident response and management. This tool doesn't define a New Zealand
government standard against which cloud service providers must demonstrate formal
compliance. Many of the questions set out in the document do, however, point toward
the importance of understanding how cloud service providers comply with a wide array
of relevant standards.

Microsoft's responses to the risk assessment
To help agencies undertake their analysis and evaluation of Microsoft enterprise cloud
services, Microsoft is producing documents showing how its enterprise cloud services
address the questions set out in the risk assessment tool by linking them to the
standards against which Microsoft cloud services are certified. These certifications are
central to how Microsoft assures both public and private sector customers that its cloud
services are designed, built, and operated to effectively mitigate privacy and security
risks and address data sovereignty concerns.

If your agency is required to undertake certification and accreditation of its Information
and Communications Technology (ICT) system under the New Zealand Information
Security Manual , then you can use these responses as part of your analysis.

Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS)
Standard for Singapore
Article • 01/31/2024

MTCS overview
The Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS) Standard for Singapore was prepared under the
direction of the Information Technology Standards Committee (ITSC) of the Infocomm
Development Authority of Singapore (IDA). The ITSC promotes and facilitates national
programs to standardize IT and communications, and Singapore's participation in
international standardization activities.

The purpose of the MTCS is to provide:

A common standard that cloud service providers (CSPs) can apply to address
customer concerns about the security and confidentiality of data in the cloud, and
the impact on businesses of using cloud services.
Verifiable operational transparency and visibility into risks to the customer when
they use cloud services.

The MTCS builds upon recognized international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, and
covers such areas as data retention, data sovereignty, data portability, liability,
availability, business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident management. It also
includes a mechanism for customers to benchmark and rank the capabilities of CSPs
against a set of minimum baseline security requirements.

MTCS is the first cloud security standard with different levels of security, so certified
CSPs can specify which levels they offer. MTCS includes a total of 535 controls, covering
basic security in Level 1, more stringent governance and tenancy controls in Level 2, and
reliability and resiliency for high-impact information systems in Level 3.

Microsoft and MTCS
After rigorous assessments conducted by the MTCS Certification Body, Microsoft cloud
services received MTCS 584:2013 certification across all three service classifications —
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service
(SaaS). Microsoft was the first global CSP to receive this certification across all three
classifications.



Certifications were granted at Level 3 for Microsoft Azure services (IaaS and PaaS),
Microsoft Dynamics 365 services (SaaS), and Microsoft Office 365 services (SaaS). A Level
3 certification means that in-scope Microsoft cloud services can host high-impact data
for regulated organizations with the strictest security requirements. It's required for
certain cloud solution implementations by the Singapore government.

Frequently asked questions
To whom does the standard apply?

It applies to businesses in Singapore that purchase cloud services requiring compliance
with the MTCS standard.

What are the differences between MTCS security levels?

MTCS has a total of 535 controls that cover three levels of security:

Level 1 is low cost, with a minimum number of required baseline security controls.
It is suitable for web site hosting, test and development work, simulation, and
noncritical business applications.
Level 2 addresses the needs of most organizations that are concerned about data
security, with a set of more stringent controls targeted at security risks and threats
to data. Level 2 is applicable for most cloud usage, including mission-critical
business applications.
Level 3 is designed for regulated organizations with specific requirements and
those willing to pay for stricter security requirements. Level 3 adds a set of security
controls to supplement those in Levels 1 and 2. They address security risks and
threats in high-impact information systems using cloud services, such as hosting
applications with sensitive information and in regulated systems.

Where do I start with my organization's own compliance effort?

The MTCS Certification Scheme  provides guidance on audit controls and security
requirements.

Can I use Microsoft's compliance in my organization's certification process?

Yes. If you have a requirement to certify your services built on these Microsoft cloud
services, you can use the MTCS certification to reduce the impact of auditing your IT
infrastructure, if it relies on them. However, you are responsible for engaging an



assessor to evaluate your implementation for compliance, and for the controls and
processes within your own organization.

ENISA IAF
Article • 09/25/2022

ENISA IAF overview
The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) is the EU agency dedicated to
achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. It works closely with EU
member states and the private sector to provide advice and recommendations on good
cybersecurity practices. ENISA also supports the development and implementation of EU
policy and law related to national information security.

The ENISA Cloud Computing Information Assurance Framework  (IAF) is a set of
assurance criteria that organizations can review with cloud service providers (CSPs) to
ensure they have sufficient protections in place for customer data. The IAF is intended to
assess the risk of cloud adoption and reduce the assurance burden on CSPs.

Azure and ENISA IAF
Microsoft Azure aligns to the IAF by way of Azure's adherence to the Cloud Security
Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which maps CCM domains and controls to
IAF assurance criteria. Azure maintains the following CCM-based assurances:

CSA STAR Level 1 Self-Assessment
CSA STAR Level 2 Certification
CSA STAR Level 2 Attestation

To review the CCM control mapping to ENISA IAF, you can download the CSA Cloud
Controls Matrix (CCM) .

７ Note

CSA CCM v3.0.1  provides control mapping to ENISA IAF. It is expected that the
new CCM v4  will be updated to include this mapping as well.

The CSA Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk (STAR)  registry is a free, publicly
accessible registry where CSPs can publish their CSA STAR assessments. Azure publishes
a CSA STAR self-assessment based on the CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative
Questionnaire (CAIQ) , which is a set of more than 250 questions based on the CCM
that a customer or cloud auditor may want to ask of CSPs to assess their compliance



with CSA best practices. Self-assessment reports are publicly available, thereby helping
you gain visibility into the security practices of CSPs, and compare various CSPs using
the same baseline.

European Union Model Clauses
Article • 01/31/2024

European Union Model Clauses overview
European Union (EU) data protection law regulates the transfer of EU customer personal
data to countries/regions outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all
EU countries/regions and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. On a practical level,
compliance with EU data protection laws also means that customers need fewer
approvals from individual authorities to transfer personal data outside of the EU, since
most EU member states don't require additional authorization if the transfer is based on
an agreement that complies with the Model Clauses.

Microsoft and European Union Model Clauses
The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the
transfer of customer personal data to countries/regions outside the European Economic
Area (EEA), which includes all EU countries/regions and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and
Norway. Microsoft offers customers the EU Standard Contractual Clauses  (SCC) (also
known as EU Model Clauses) that provide specific guarantees around transfers of
personal data for in-scope services. The EU Model Clauses are used in agreements
between service providers (such as Microsoft) and their customers to ensure that any
personal data leaving the EEA will be transferred in compliance with the GDPR.

In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US
Privacy Shield Framework for transfers of personal data from the EU to the United
States. However, the EU Model Clauses continue to provide a valid mechanism for the
transfer of personal data from the EU and EEA, as well as from Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. Microsoft makes the EU Model Clauses available to customers as
described in the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST) Data Protection Addendum
(DPA).

Frequently asked questions
Why is compliance with the Model Clauses important?

A service provider that commits contractually to the Model Clauses gives its customers
assurance that personal data will be transferred and processed in compliance with EU
data protection law. Use of the Model Clauses also means that customers need to get



fewer approvals from individual data-protection authorities to transfer personal data
outside the EU.

Where can I see compliance information for Microsoft services?

Compliance is a contractual commitment. Microsoft Standard Contractual Clauses are
available to all cloud customers in the Online Services Terms ; for other services, see
your existing agreement with Microsoft.

What is a 'sub-processor'?

A sub-processor is someone who processes personal data following the data controller's
instructions, and the terms of the EU Model Clauses and the subcontract. Microsoft
customers—independent software vendors (ISVs), in particular, are sometimes
themselves data processors. In those instances, Microsoft is the sub-processor.

Where do I start with my own organization's compliance efforts?

You can enter an agreement such, as the Online Services Terms , or explore amending
your existing agreement to incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses.

Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria
Catalog (C5)
Article • 03/21/2025

C5 overview
In 2016, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der
Informationstechnik, or BSI) created the Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5).
The BSI revised the guidance as the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalog (C5:2020) in
2020. C5 is an audited standard that establishes a mandatory minimum baseline for cloud
security and the adoption of public cloud solutions by German government agencies and
organizations that work with government. C5 is also being increasingly adopted by the private
sector.

The purpose of the C5 catalog of requirements is to provide a consistent security framework
for certifying cloud service providers and to give customers assurance that their data will be
managed securely.

C5 is based on internationally recognized IT security standards like ISO/IEC 27001:2013, the
Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix 3.0.1, and BSI's own IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.
The catalog consists of 114 requirements across 17 domains, for example, the organization of
information security and physical security, with security requirements basic to all cloud service
providers, and other requirements for processing highly confidential data and situations
requiring high availability.

The BSI also puts emphasis on transparency. As part of an audit, the cloud provider must
include a detailed system description and disclose environmental parameters like jurisdiction
and data processing location, provision of services, and other certifications issued to the cloud
services, and information about the cloud provider's disclosure obligations to public
authorities. This system helps potential cloud customers decide whether the cloud services
meet their essential requirements such as compliance with legal requirements like data
protection, company policies, or the ability to address the threat of industrial espionage.

Microsoft and C5
Microsoft cloud services are audited at least annually against SOC 2 (AT Section 101) standards.
According to BSI, a C5 audit can be combined with a SOC 2 audit to reuse parts of the system
description and audit results for overlapping controls. Microsoft Azure, Azure Government, and
Azure Germany maintain a combined report (C5, SOC 2 Type 2, CSA STAR Attestation) based



on the audit assessment performed by an independent auditor, which demonstrates proof of
compliance with C5.

Frequently asked questions
Can I use Microsoft compliance with C5 to help my organization get its own C5 attestation?

Yes. You may use the attestation of Microsoft cloud services as the foundation for any program
or initiative that requires C5. However, you need to achieve your own C5 attestation for
components outside or built on top of these services.

What's the difference between C5 and the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues?

IT-Grundschutz supplies the specific methodology to help organizations identify and
implement security measures for IT systems and is one of the elements upon which the C5
standards are built. C5 provides a set of audit standards for cloud service providers but leaves
the details of implementation up to the cloud service provider.

What is Microsoft Cloud Germany?

Microsoft Cloud Germany is physically based in Germany, adhering to the requirements of
German privacy law, which limits the transfer of personal data to other nations and offers
protection against access by authorities from other jurisdictions who could violate domestic
laws. Azure Germany delivers Azure services from German datacenters with data residency in
Germany, and it delivers strict data access and control measures provided through a unique
data trustee model governed under German law.

Germany IT-Grundschutz workbook overview
To help organizations secure IT systems, the German Federal Office for Information
Security  (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, or BSI) created a
baseline set of standards for protecting information technology (in German, IT-
Grundschutz). These standards consist of:

BSI Standard 200-1 defines an an information security management system (ISMS)
based on ISO/IEC 27001
BSI Standard 200-2 describes how to set up and operate an ISMS according to the
IT-Grundschutz methodology
BSI Standard 200-3 contains all risk-related tasks
The IT-Grundschutz Catalogues describe potential threats and safeguards for
typical business environments

Microsoft and IT-Grundschutz workbooks
To help you achieve your IT-Grundschutz certification, Microsoft Germany has published
the IT-Grundschutz Compliance workbooks for solutions and workloads deployed on
Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365. Developed by HiSolutions AG, an independent
consulting and auditing firm in Germany, the workbooks are based on IT-Grundschutz
Catalogue 2021, which includes modules covering internet and cloud usage, such as
OPS.2.2 Cloud Usage, and updates to the IT-Grundschutz Catalogue from 2023.

Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Rijksdienst
standard (BIR 2012)
Article • 03/21/2025

BIR 2012 overview
Organizations operating in the Netherlands government sector must demonstrate compliance
with the Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Rijksdienst standard (BIR 2012). The BIR 2012 provides
a standard framework based on ISO 27001 and ISO 27002. For organizations using Microsoft
Azure or Microsoft 365, Microsoft manages part of the BIR 2012 controls for these cloud
services in line with the shared responsibility model in cloud computing. Organizations that
need to comply with BIR 2012 are therefore required to determine if the underlying Microsoft
services they're using are compliant with BIR 2012.

The BIR coverage report provides guidance where the BIR standards are covered by existing
ISO 27001 certifications that are available for Microsoft cloud services. Where there are
additional BIR controls that aren't covered by ISO 27001, references are made to other
independent attestations, audit documentation, or contractual statements.

Microsoft and BIR 2012
While Microsoft isn't subject to BIR 2012 compliance, customers from the government sector
seeking to use cloud services can use Microsoft's existing certifications to determine their
compliance with this standard. Azure and Microsoft 365 undergo various periodic independent
certifications and attestations, some of which are closely related to BIR 2012.

Microsoft 365 environments



Microsoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated experience
of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide. Most Office 365
services enable customers to specify the region where their customer data is located. Microsoft
may replicate customer data to other regions within the same geographic area (for example,
the United States) for data resiliency, but Microsoft will not replicate customer data outside the
chosen geographic area.

This section covers the following Office 365 environments:

Client software (Client): commercial client software running on customer devices.
Office 365 (Commercial): the commercial public Office 365 cloud service available
globally.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC): the Office 365 GCC cloud service is
available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments, and contractors
holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.
Office 365 Government Community Cloud - High (GCC High): the Office 365 GCC High
cloud service is designed according to Department of Defense (DoD) Security
Requirements Guidelines Level 4 controls and supports strictly regulated federal and
defense information. This environment is used by federal agencies, the Defense Industrial
Base (DIBs), and government contractors.
Office 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to DoD
Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal and defense
regulations. This environment is for the exclusive use by the US Department of Defense.

Audits, reports, and certificates
Microsoft retained an independent, third-party auditing firm to analyze the extent to which
current Azure and Microsoft 365 certifications and attestations (such as ISO/IEC 27001 and SOC
2 Type 2) cover the part of BIR 2012 that Microsoft is responsible for. The resulting report
provides a mapping of these existing certifications and attestations to the controls listed in the
BIR 2012 standard. Customers can use the report as a tool to help adopt Azure in a BIR 2012
compliant way. The report clearly demonstrates which BIR 2012 controls are covered by
Microsoft and which controls remain to be implemented by the customers. The 'Microsoft
Cloud: Azure and Office 365 BIR 2012 Baseline Coverage' report can be downloaded from the
Service Trust Portal Audit Reports - GRC Assessment Reports  section.

Frequently asked questions
Is Microsoft BIR 2012 certified?

The responsibility for BIR compliance is applicable to the government sector. It requires the
organization to implement an information security management system and to address risk
with appropriate technical and organizational measures. For Microsoft in its role as cloud
service provider, BIR compliance is not the objective, nor is it technically feasible. When a
customer implements or uses Microsoft cloud services, those services may be in scope of a BIR
evaluation. However, the organization must add its own (additional) controls, choices, and
processes, which are part of the overall BIR evaluation. The objective of the report is to
demonstrate that a government agency can adopt Microsoft cloud services in a manner that is
compliant with BIR 2012.

Is a customer that uses Microsoft cloud services compliant with BIR 2012?

Demonstrating BIR compliance is the responsibility of the customer. Customers using a cloud
services vendor typically demand assurances from the vendor, and add their own (additional)
technology and organizational decisions, choices, and processes. This effort results in an overall
assessment by the customer on its BIR compliance, which can be submitted for review or
certification to a third-party auditor. The BIR coverage report provides insight into what BIR



controls are covered by Microsoft cloud services, but as such does not cover end-to-end
compliance.

The report does not show 100% coverage. Is BIR 2012 compliance not feasible?

Microsoft cloud services provide many controls that help organizations within the Netherlands
with their BIR compliance needs. However, an organization needs to complement those vendor
assurances with their own implementation choices, additional technology controls, and
administrative processes. The report shows already over 91% direct coverage of the full list of
applicable controls. For the remaining controls, Microsoft provides guidance in the report on
how compliance with those controls can be demonstrated.

Is the BIR coverage report a legal binding document?

No. It is a supporting tool for the customer's internal BIR assurance process and helps to
establish confidence and trust that BIR compliance is feasible. The report has a descriptive
status and includes a legal disclaimer.

Can we share this report?

The report is provided to customers under a non-disclosure agreement, on the basis that it is
for customer information only and that it will not be copied or disclosed via other channels
than the Microsoft Service Trust Platform . Customers can share the report with their own
internal or external auditor as part of their compliance or assurance processes.

Qatar National Information Assurance
(NIA) certification
08/21/2025

Qatar NIA Certification Overview
The National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) of the State of Qatar has endorsed the National
Information Assurance (NIA) Policy , which guides organizations in classifying the impact of
information security threats and risk. The NIA Policy was established by the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology  (MCIT) (Previously MOTC). It helps all
government entities and other organizations in Qatar with the selection of suitable mitigating
controls to:

Protect information assets,
Effectively manage information security risks,
Achieve regulatory compliance, and
Ease the compliance journey for international standards certifications, for example, ISO
27001.

The NIA Policy is applicable to all business segments. It specifies a high-level information
classification methodology for entities in the State of Qatar. The rationale for information
classification is to apply appropriate classification levels to data, determine risks, and apply
corresponding protection. The following threats are addressed in the NIA Policy:

Unauthorized disclosure
Unauthorized modification
Non-availability

To achieve NIA compliance, an organization must implement an Information Security
Management System (ISMS) based on the NIA Policy requirements. The NIA certification
process includes:

Scope preparation and documentation to help the NCSA Governance and Assurance
Affairs understand the boundaries of compliance assessment.
Audit planning, including engaging an accredited auditor and agreeing on assessment
activities.
Compliance audit and in-depth controls assessment, which enables the auditor to furnish
an audit report to the NCSA Governance and Assurance Affairs upon audit completion.
Compliance certification decision and award, whereby the NCSA Governance and
Assurance Affairs determines if the applicant has adequately implemented the necessary



information security controls, leading to certification upon successful completion.

Also, National Information Assurance (NIA) Certification is part of the National Information
Security Compliance Framework (NISCF) of National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) of the State
of Qatar.

Microsoft and Qatar NIA
To comply with national, regional, and industry specific requirements governing the collection
and use of individuals' data, Microsoft seeks applicable certifications and attestations for its
cloud services. Microsoft accomplishes this breadth of compliance offerings with a two-
pronged approach:

A team of Microsoft experts works with engineering and operations teams to track
existing standards and regulations, developing hundreds of controls for the product
teams to build into the cloud services.
As regulations and standards evolve, compliance experts also plan for upcoming changes
to help ensure continuous compliance.

Microsoft completed a rigorous assessment of Microsoft Azure services, including their
development, operations, and infrastructure by an accredited third-party auditing firm as part
of the NIA certification process. Also, all critical business processes involved in onboarding,
provisioning, and servicing entities on Microsoft Azure are covered during NIA audit.

Applicability
The following Azure public cloud regions that are part of the Azure Qatar program are in scope
for the NIA certification:

West Europe (Netherlands)
North Europe (Ireland)
Qatar Central (Qatar)

Attestation Documents
You can access Azure Qatar NIA audit documents from the Service Trust Portal (STP) Qatar
regional resources  section. For instructions on how to access audit reports, see Audit
documentation.

Azure Qatar NIA certificate is valid for three years, and the maintenance audit is required to
perform annually.



Frequently Asked Questions
To whom do the NIA Policy guidelines apply?

The policy applies to all agencies and their corresponding information assets unless specifically
exempted by statute or regulation. The following normative references apply:

Law No.14 of 2014: Combatting Cybercrime Law
Law No.13 of 2016: Personal Data Privacy Protection Law
Information Assurance Framework, 2008
National Information Assurance Policy
2014 Qatar National Cybersecurity Strategy, 2014
National Data Classification Policy

Where can I get more information on NIA requirements?

The policy can be accessed from NSCA .

How has Microsoft’s response to the NIA Policy requirements been validated?

Microsoft Qatar commits to:

Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the provision of Microsoft online
services in scope for the NIA certification.
Collaborate with stakeholders and customers to understand how regional laws or
regulations may impact their use of Microsoft online services. Microsoft complies with
organizational information security requirements and employs security controls in
accordance with applicable laws, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance to
provide proper assurances for its online services.

Can I use Microsoft's response in my organization's compliance process?

Yes. If you have a certification requirement with a dependency on Microsoft Azure, you can use
Microsoft’s NIA certification to reduce the impact of compliance assessment on your IT
infrastructure. However, you are responsible for evaluating your implementation for
compliance and for the controls and processes within your own organization.

Russian Personal Data Localization
Requirements
Article • 01/31/2024

As of September 1, 2015, organizations that are considered personal data operators
must ensure that, when collecting personal data, Russian citizens' personal data
recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification (updating, changing), and
extraction are performed through the databases located in Russia ('personal data
localization requirement').1

Microsoft services available to organizations (including but not limited to educational
institutions) (hereinafter referred to as 'customer'), including those enabling personal
data processing such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power
Platform, are provided from data processing centers located outside of Russia (for more
information visit the Microsoft Trust Center ).

Based on the type and content of information processed by customer information
systems, such systems, including those using Microsoft cloud products, may be deemed
a personal data information system ('PDIS', 'ISPD'). In cases where the customer would
like to use Microsoft services in a system that qualifies as PDIS through its architecture
and types of information processed, Microsoft invites its customers to consider,
amongst other things, available solutions specified below. All the scenarios provided are
available for customers as an additional option to standard business offerings.

It should be noted that it is the customer as personal data operator of PDIS who is in
charge of compliance and shall analyze and assess applicable legal requirements for
personal data localization, and at its own discretion, independently determine sufficient
measures to ensure that personal data processing in PDIS complies with the Russian
personal data law.2

Subscribing to Microsoft services

Microsoft ID Management
Microsoft invites customers to consider subscribing to Microsoft services; Microsoft
Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform—via a Microsoft Cloud

Spain Esquema Nacional de Seguridad
(ENS) High-Level Security Measures
Article • 03/21/2025

Spain ENS overview
In 2007, the Spanish government enacted Law 11/2007, which established a legal framework to
give citizens electronic access to government and public services. This law is the basis for
Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (National Security Framework), which is governed by the
updated Royal Decree (RD) 311/2022. The goal of the framework is to build trust in the
provision of electronic services, and ensure the access, integrity, availability, authenticity,
confidentiality, traceability, and preservation of data, information, and services.

The framework applies to all public organizations and government agencies in Spain that
purchase cloud services, as well as to providers of information and communications
technologies (ICT). It guides these agencies and companies in implementing effective controls
for security in the cloud and on premises, in compliance with Spanish and EU security and
privacy standards.

The framework establishes core policies and mandatory requirements that both government
agencies and their service providers must meet. It defines a set of specific security controls,
many of which align directly with ISO/IEC 27001, relating to availability, authenticity, integrity,
confidentiality, and traceability. The sensitivity of the information, low, intermediate, or high,
determines the security measures that must be applied to protect it.

Each government agency is required to adopt a risk-management approach to security,
whereby they identify and assess risks, and then apply security controls appropriate to those
risks. Service providers, too, must comply with the stringent framework requirements to help
ensure that their procedures, technical capacities, and operations are secure and enable
agencies to comply with the regulations.

The framework prescribes an accreditation process that is voluntary for systems handling
information of low sensitivity, but mandatory for systems handling information at an
intermediate or high level of sensitivity. An audit is performed by an accredited independent
auditor. The report is then reviewed in a process of certification before risk-management
controls are accepted in the final step of accreditation.

Microsoft and Spain ENS high-level security
measures



Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 have gone through a rigorous assessment by BDO, an
independent auditor, which issued an official statement of their compliance. BDO reports that
the security measures in both services, and their information systems and data processing
facilities, comply at the high level with RD 311/2022 without requiring any corrective measures.
Microsoft was the first hyperscale cloud service provider to receive this certification in Spain.

Frequently asked questions
How can I get copies of the audit reports and certifications?

The Service Trust Portal  provides the audit reports and certifications in both Spanish and
English. Your auditors can use them to compare Microsoft cloud services results with your own
legal and regulatory requirements.

Where do I start with my organization's own compliance effort?

If your organization is using Azure or Office 365, you can use ENS Microsoft audit reports and
accreditation as part of your own accreditation process. However, you are responsible for



engaging an auditor to evaluate your implementation for compliance, and for ensuring that the
controls and processes within your own organization align with the framework.

UAE DESC CSP Security Standard
Article • 04/05/2023

UAE DESC CSP Security Standard overview
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Dubai Electronic Security Center  (DESC) was founded
in 2014 with the aim to develop and implement information security practices across the
Dubai Emirate. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Security Standard  produced by DESC
sets out requirements and guidance for CSPs and organizations using any cloud
services. Compliance with this standard is mandatory for all CSPs wishing to offer cloud
services to Dubai government and semi-government entities.

The DESC CSP Security Standard is based on the following standards:

ISO/IEC 27001:2013
ISO/IEC 27002:2013
ISO/IEC 27017:2015
Dubai Government Information Security Regulation (ISR) 2017
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) 3.0.1

The CSP Security Standard contains mandatory requirements for CSPs offering their
services to government and semi-government entities in Dubai. It also provides
guidance for customers of these CSPs. Government and semi-government organizations
in Dubai must ensure that any CSP they're using complies with this standard.

Throughout the development of the CSP Security Standard, DESC sought strong
alignment with established international standards to streamline the certification
process. Consequently, if a CSP is already certified against ISO/IEC 27001:2013, this part
of the CSP Security Standard wouldn't be audited again; instead, the ISO/IEC 27001:2013
certificate would be simply accepted. The same logic applies for other existing standards
on which the CSP Security Standard is based. For example, if a CSP is already certified
against CSA STAR Level 2, this certificate would be accepted without any further audit.

To facilitate this process, DESC has issued a set of requirements for certification bodies
seeking DESC accreditation to perform certification work against the CSP Security
Standard. A certification body approved by DESC can then check the validity of CSPs
existing certifications and inform DESC about the status. In case certification is
warranted, the certification body should inform DESC after completing all required
activities. Extra audit work by a certification body may be needed, for example, physical
on-site inspection of datacenter facilities or other examination as required by DESC.



Microsoft and DESC CSP Security Standard
Microsoft was the first global cloud services provider to obtain the DESC CSP Security
Standard certification. Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365 are already
certified under ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27017:2015. Moreover, Azure maintains
both CSA STAR Level 2 Certification and CSA STAR Level 2 Attestation.

To support Dubai government and semi-government entities that are concerned about
data residency, Microsoft has established two UAE data centers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
These data centers add in-country data residency , failover, and disaster recovery for
customer data and applications.

Microsoft retained an independent third-party auditing firm (certification body)
accredited by DESC to perform the CSP Security Standard certification of Microsoft
Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365, including the physical inspection of datacenter
facilities in two Azure UAE regions. Following the completion of these activities,
Microsoft was granted the CSP Security Standard certification.

Applicability
Azure

The DESC CSP Security Standard certificate applies to two Azure UAE regions: UAE
Central (Abu Dhabi) and UAE North (Dubai).

Services in scope
Microsoft cloud services in audit scope are shown in the CSP Security Standard
certificate:

Azure Core Services

UK Cyber Essentials Plus
Article • 04/05/2023

UK Cyber Essentials Plus overview
Cyber Essentials  is a UK government-backed scheme designed to help organizations
assess and mitigate risks from common cyber security threats to their IT systems. It
identifies security controls for an organization to have in place within their IT systems.
Cyber Essentials scheme is a requirement for all UK government suppliers handling any
personal data. The Cyber Essentials badge helps an organization demonstrate the ability
to:

Identify potential risks to better protect against common cyber threats.
Adopt proper security controls to protect customer data.
Become compliant with UK government expectations for Cyber Security Essential
requirements and eligible to bid on UK government contracts.

The Cyber Essentials Scheme  is designed for UK government suppliers to identify
potential weaknesses in their IT systems and software, which could lead to customer
data exploits. The scheme assurance framework has defined two different levels of
certification:

Cyber Essentials is the first level and includes a self-assessment for organizations
to check the most important IT security controls of their IT infrastructure. The
responses are independently reviewed by an external certifying body.
Cyber Essentials Plus offers the same controls coverage as Cyber Essentials and
also includes additional assurance by carrying out systems tests of implemented
controls through an authorized third-party certifying body.

Azure and UK Cyber Essentials Plus
Microsoft Azure has attained the Cyber Essentials Plus badge and meets the
requirements outlined in the Cyber Essentials Scheme. Azure production systems are
frequently tested and audited to provide evidence of an industry-leading compliance
portfolio.

Applicability
Azure

United Kingdom Government-Cloud (G-
Cloud)
Article • 02/01/2024

UK G-Cloud overview
Government Cloud (G-Cloud) is a UK government initiative to ease procurement of
cloud services by government departments and promote government-wide adoption of
cloud computing. G-Cloud comprises a series of framework agreements with cloud
services suppliers (such as Microsoft), and a listing of their services in an online store,
the Digital Marketplace. These enable public-sector organizations to compare and
procure those services without having to do their own full review process. Inclusion in
the Digital Marketplace requires a self-attestation of compliance, followed by a
verification performed by the Government Digital Service (GDS) branch at its discretion.

The G-Cloud appointment process was streamlined in 2014 to reduce the time and cost
to the UK government, and the government's security classification scheme was
simplified from six to three levels: OFFICIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET. (G-Cloud
certification levels are no longer expressed as an Impact Level, or IL; Microsoft formerly
held an IL2 accreditation for Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft
Office 365.)

Instead of the central assessment of cloud services previously provided, the new process
requires cloud service providers to self-certify and supply evidence in support of the 14
Cloud Security Principles of G-Cloud. This has not changed either the evidence
Microsoft produces or the standards that the company adheres to.

Microsoft and UK G-Cloud
Every year, Microsoft prepares documentation and submits evidence to attest that its in-
scope enterprise cloud services comply with the principles, giving potential G-Cloud
customers an overview of its risk environment. (As with previous G-Cloud accreditation,
it relies on the ISO 27001 certification.) A GDS accreditor then performs several random
checks on the Microsoft assertion statement, samples the evidence, and makes a
determination of compliance.

The appointment of Microsoft services to the Digital Marketplace means that UK
government agencies and partners can use in-scope services to store and process UK
OFFICIAL government data, most government data. In addition, there are now more



than 450 Microsoft partners included in G-Cloud who are resellers of Microsoft cloud
services. They can directly assert the compliance of in-scope services with the 14
principles in their own applications. Customers and partners, however, will need to
achieve their own compliance for any components that are not included in the
attestation and determination of compliance for Microsoft cloud services.

service is available for United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments,
and contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government.



Office 365 Government Community Cloud - High (GCC High): the Office 365 GCC
High cloud service is designed according to Department of Defense (DoD) Security
Requirements Guidelines Level 4 controls and supports strictly regulated federal
and defense information. This environment is used by federal agencies, the
Defense Industrial Base (DIBs), and government contractors.
Office 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to
DoD Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal
and defense regulations. This environment is for the exclusive use by the US
Department of Defense.

UK Police-Assured Secure Facilities
(PASF)
Article • 09/25/2022

UK PASF overview
The National Policing Information Risk Management Team (NPIRMT) of the UK Home
Office is charged with ensuring that the storage of and access to police information
meet its standards. The NPIRMT provides a range of information assurance  functions
to the police community. It sets the central standards and controls for law enforcement
agencies across the UK that are assessing the risk of moving police information systems
to the cloud. The information assurance policy requires that all national police services
in the UK that store and process protectively marked or other sensitive law enforcement
information take an extra step in their risk assessment — a physical inspection of the
datacenter where their data will be stored. A successful datacenter assessment
determines that the facility qualifies for PASF.

Azure and UK PASF
Microsoft Azure can support UK law enforcement IT customers who require Police-
Assured Secure Facilities (PASF) to process and store their data in the cloud. The NPIRMT
completed a comprehensive security assessment of the physical infrastructure of
Microsoft Azure datacenters in the UK, and concluded that they're in compliance with
NPIRMT requirements. There were no compliance issues or necessary remedial actions
identified as a result of this assessment. Risks identified during PASF audits are managed
according to cyber risk assurance of national systems  provided by NPIRMT.

Local police services can use the NPIRMT assessment to support their own review. Using
the NPIRMT policy guidelines, the senior information risk owner for each police service
is responsible for assessing the suitability of an individual datacenter in the context of
their particular application, which they then submit to the NPIRMT for approval.

Microsoft takes a holistic defense-in-depth approach to security. Our UK datacenters
(like all Microsoft datacenters) are certified to comply with the most comprehensive
portfolio of internationally recognized standards of any cloud service provider and
consistently meet those requirements.

These certifications are backed by the measures that we take to protect the physical
security of our datacenters. We adopt a layered approach that starts with how we



design, build, and operate datacenters to strictly control physical access to the areas
where customer data is stored. Microsoft datacenters have extensive levels of protection
with access approval required at the facility’s perimeter, at the building’s perimeter,
inside the building, and on the datacenter floor. This structure reduces the risk of
unauthorized users gaining physical access to datacenter resources.

Applicability
Azure UK datacenter physical infrastructure

Audit reports and certificates
The NPIRMT audits one Azure datacenter each year, annually cycling through the four
Microsoft datacenters in the UK. The NPIRMT assessment that Microsoft datacenters are
PASF is available through the Home Office for law enforcement customers who are
conducting their own risk assessment regarding the use of cloud services.

How to implement
Microsoft provides the Azure Policy regulatory compliance built-in initiative for UK
OFFICIAL and UK NHS, which maps to UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS compliance
domains and controls. Regulatory compliance in Azure Policy provides built-in
initiative definitions to view a list of controls and compliance domains based on
responsibility - customer, Microsoft, or shared. For Microsoft-responsible controls,
we provide extra audit result details based on third-party attestations and our
control implementation details to achieve that compliance. Each UK OFFICIAL and
UK NHS control is associated with one or more Azure Policy definitions. These
policies may help you assess compliance with the control; however, compliance in
Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. Azure Policy
helps to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale. Through
its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall
state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to more granular status.

Frequently asked questions
Can police departments in the UK use the Azure PASF assessment as part of their own
risk assessments?
Yes. Law enforcement can use the NPIRMT assessment of Azure to support their own
local risk assessment before a move to the cloud.

General Data Protection Regulation
Summary
Article • 12/01/2024

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations
that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and
analyze data for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located. This
document guides you to information to help you honor rights and fulfill obligations
under the GDPR when using Microsoft products and services. A Recommended action
plan for GDPR and Accountability Readiness Checklists provide additional resources for
assessing and implementing GDPR compliance.

Terminology
Helpful definitions for GDPR terms used in this document:

Data Controller (Controller): A legal person, public authority, agency or other
body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of
the processing of personal data.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who
can be identified, directly or indirectly.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: Data produced and stored in the day-to-day operations of
running your business.

What is the GDPR?
The GDPR gives rights to people to manage personal data collected by an organization.
These rights can be exercised through a Data Subject Request (DSR). The organization is
required to provide timely information regarding DSRs and data breaches, and perform
Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).

Several points should be considered when implementing or assessing GDPR
requirements:

Developing or evaluating your GDPR-compliance data privacy policy.
Assessing the data security of your organization.



Who is your data controller?
What data security processes may you have to perform?

The Recommended action plan for GDPR and Accountability Readiness Checklists may
prompt additional thinking points.

The following tasks are involved to meet GDPR standards. Follow the links in the list for
details regarding your implementation.

Data subject requests (DSR). A formal request by a data subject to a controller to
take an action (change, restrict, access) regarding their personal data.
Breach notification. Under GDPR, a personal data breach is 'a breach of security
leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise
processed.'
Data protection impact assessment (DPIA). Data controllers are required under
GDPR to prepare a DPIA for data operations that are 'likely to result in a high risk
to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.'

As mentioned above, the Recommended action plan for GDPR and Accountability
Readiness Checklists provide a guide to implementing or assessing GDPR conformance
using Microsoft products and services.

Use Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager to
assess your risk
Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager is a feature in the Microsoft Purview
compliance portal to help you understand your organization's compliance posture and
take actions to help reduce risks. Compliance Manager has a pre-built assessment for
this regulation for Enterprise E5 customers. Find the template for building the
assessment in the assessment templates page in Compliance Manager. Learn how to
build assessments in Compliance Manager.

Data Subject Request (DSR)
The GDPR grants individuals (or data subjects) certain rights in connection with the
processing of their personal data, including the right to correct inaccurate data, erase
data or restrict its processing, receive their data and fulfill a request to transmit their
data to another controller. The controller is responsible for providing a timely, GDPR
consistent reply. For technical details, refer to Data Subject Requests.



DSR FAQs
What actions will be required to complete a DSR?

DSRs involve six activities: Discovery, Access, Rectification, Restriction, Export, and
Deletion.

What are your data sources?

A large fraction of an organization's data is generated in Office applications such as
Excel and Outlook. You may also find data relevant to a DSR in Insights generated by
Microsoft products and services, and system-generated logs.

What kinds of data need to be searched?

Personal data may be found in customer data, insights generated by Microsoft products
and services, and system-generated logs.

How will personal data be searched?

Searching for personal data may vary across Microsoft products and services. Search
tools include Content Search, or in-app search capacity. Administrators may access
system-generated logs associated with a user's activity.

In what formats should personal data be made available?

The GDPR 'right of data portability' allows a data subject to request a copy of personal
data in a 'structured, commonly used, machine-readable format', and to request that
your organization transmit these files to another data controller.

What does the GDPR require and what are my responsibilities as the controller?

As controller, the GDPR requires you to be able to:

Give data subjects a copy of their personal data, together with an explanation of
the categories of their data that are being processed, the purposes of that
processing, and the categories of third parties to whom their data may be
disclosed.
Help every individual exercise their right to correct inaccurate personal data, erase
data or restrict its processing, receive their data in a readable form, and where
applicable, fulfill a request to transmit their data to another controller.

What does the GDPR require and what are the responsibilities of Microsoft as
processor?



We must implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist you
in responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights as discussed above.

Where can I find GDPR-related information for on-premises servers?

You can find a series of GDPR-related articles here. Produced by Microsoft, they provide
recommended approaches for on-premises workload for SharePoint Server, Exchange
Server, Project Server, Office Web Apps Server, Office Online Server, and on-premises
file shares.

How does Microsoft enable you to respond to data subject requests?

Online Services offers a host of capabilities to enable you, as a controller, to respond to
a data subject's request. Microsoft enterprise online services and administrative controls
help you act on personal data responsive to data subject rights requests, allowing you
to discover, access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export personal data that resides in the
controller-managed data stored in Microsoft's cloud. Online Services also provides data
in machine-readable form should you need it.

Data Protection Impact Assessment
Under GDPR, data controllers are required to prepare a Data Protection Impact
Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are 'likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons.' There is nothing inherent in Microsoft products
and services that need the creation of a DPIA. Rather, it depends on the details of your
Microsoft configuration. A list of details that must be considered in Office can be found
in Contents of DPIA

DPIA FAQs
When should you conduct a DPIA?

Controllers are required to perform a DPIA addressing risks to personal data security or
as a result of a data breach. Specific examples of risk factors in Office are addressed in
Determining Whether a DPIA is Needed.

What is required to complete a DPIA?

The GDPR mandates that a DPIA includes:

Assessment of the necessity, and proportionality of data processing in relation to
the DPIA's purpose.
An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.



Intended measures to address the risks, safeguards, security measures, and
mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and demonstrate
compliance with the GDPR.

What are my responsibilities as a Controller?

Under the GDPR, as a controller you are required to undertake DPIAs prior to data
processing that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals
—in particular, processing using new technologies. The GDPR provides the following
non-exhaustive list of cases in which DPIAs must be carried out:

Automated processing for the purposes of profiling and similar activities that has
legal effects or similarly significantly affects data subjects;
Processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data-data revealing
racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, and the like—or of data relating to criminal
convictions and offenses;
Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.

The GDPR also requires that you must consult with your Data Protection Authority (DPA)
before you begin any processing if you cannot identify sufficient processes to minimize
high risks to data subjects.

What are the responsibilities of Microsoft?

Microsoft practices privacy by design and privacy by default in its engineering and
business functions. As part of these efforts, Microsoft performs comprehensive privacy
reviews on data processing operations that have the potential to cause impacts to the
rights and freedoms of data subjects. Privacy teams embedded in the service groups
review the design and implementation of services to ensure that personal data is
processed in a respectful manner that accords with international law, user expectations,
and our express commitments.

These privacy reviews tend to be granular — a particular service may receive dozens or
hundreds of reviews. Microsoft rolls up these granular privacy reviews into Data
Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) that cover major groupings of processing, which
the Microsoft EU Data Protection Officer (DPO) then reviews. The DPO assesses the risks
related to the data processing to ensure that sufficient mitigations are in place. If the
DPO finds unmitigated risks, changes are recommended back to the engineering group.
DPIAs will be reviewed and updated as data protection risks change.

Microsoft, as a processor, has a duty to assist controllers in ensuring compliance with
the DPIA requirements laid out in the GDPR. To support our customers, relevant sections
of Microsoft's DPIAs are abstracted and will be provided through this section in future



updates with the intent of allowing controllers relying on Microsoft services to leverage
the abstracts in order to create their own DPIAs.

Breach Notification
The GDPR mandates notification requirements for data controllers and processors for a
breach of personal data. As a data processor, Microsoft ensures that customers are able
to meet the GDPR's breach notification requirements. Data controllers are responsible
for assessing risks to data privacy and determining whether a breach requires
notification of a customer's DPA. Microsoft provides the information needed to make
that assessment. More information about how Microsoft detects and responds to a
breach of personal data in Data Breach Notification Under the GDPR.

Breach notification FAQs
What constitutes a breach of personal data under the GDPR?

Personal data means any information related to an individual that can be used to
identify them directly or indirectly. A personal data breach is 'a breach of security
leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.'

What are your responsibilities as the controller?

If a breach of personal data that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and
freedoms of individuals (such as discrimination, identity theft, fraud, financial loss, or
damage to their reputation) occurs, the GDPR requires you to:

Notify the appropriate Data Protection Authority (DPA) within 72 hours of
becoming aware of it—for example, after Microsoft notifies you. If you don't notify
the DPA within that time period, you'll need to explain why to the DPA. This notice
to the DPA is required even where there is a risk to individuals that is not likely to
result in a high risk.
Notify the data subjects of the breach without undue delay.
Document the breach including a description of the nature of the breach—such as
how many people were impacted, the number of data records affected, the
consequences of the breach, and any remedial action your organization is
proposing or took.

What are the responsibilities of Microsoft as the processor?



After we become aware of a personal data breach, the GDPR requires us to notify you
without undue delay. Where Microsoft is a processor our obligations reflect both GDPR
requirements and our standard, worldwide contractual provisions. We consider that all
confirmed personal data breaches are in scope; there is no risk of harm threshold. We
will notify our customers whether the data breach was suffered by Microsoft directly or
by any of our sub-processors. We have processes in place to quickly identify and contact
security incident personnel you've identified in your organization. In addition, all sub-
processors are contractually obliged to report their own breaches to Microsoft, and
provide guarantees to that effect.

How will Microsoft detect a data breach?

All our services and personnel follow internal incident management procedures to
ensure that we take proper precautions to avoid data breaches in the first place.
However, in addition, Online Services have specific security controls in place across our
platforms to detect data breaches in the rare event that they occur.

How will Microsoft respond to a data breach?

To support you for a breach of personal data Microsoft has: - Security personnel trained
on the specific procedures to follow. - Has policies, procedures, and controls in place to
ensure that Microsoft maintains detailed records. This response includes documentation
that captures the facts of the incident, its effects, and remedial action, as well as tracking
and storing information in our incident management systems.

How will Microsoft notify me in the event of a data breach?

Microsoft has policies and procedures in place to notify you promptly. To satisfy your
notice requirements to the DPA, we will provide a description of the process we used to
determine if a breach of personal data has occurred, a description of the nature of the
breach and a description of the measures we took to mitigate the breach.

Accountability Readiness Checklists for the
GDPR
These checklists provide a convenient way to access information you may need to
support the GDPR using Microsoft products. You can manage checklist items with
Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager by referencing the Control ID and Control Title
under Customer Managed Controls in the GDPR tile.

GDPR FAQs



Does Microsoft make commitments to its customers with regard to the GDPR?

Yes. The GDPR requires controllers (such as organizations using Microsoft's enterprise
online services) only use processors (such as Microsoft) that provide sufficient
guarantees to meet key requirements of the GDPR. Microsoft has taken the proactive
step of providing these commitments to all Volume Licensing customers as part of their
agreements.

How does Microsoft help me comply?

Microsoft provides tools and documentation to support your GDPR accountability. This
includes support for Data Subject Rights, performing your own Data Protection Impact
Assessments, and working together to resolve personal data breaches.

What commitments are in the GDPR Terms?

Microsoft's GDPR Terms reflect the commitments required of processors in Article 28.
Article 28 requires that processors commit to:

Only use subprocessors with the consent of the controller and remain liable for
subprocessors.

Under what basis does Microsoft facilitate the transfer of personal data outside of the
EU?

Microsoft has long used the Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as the Model
Clauses) as a basis for transfer of data for its enterprise online services. The Standard
Contractual Clauses are standard terms provided by the European Commission that can
be used to transfer data outside the European Economic Area in a compliant manner.
Microsoft has incorporated the Standard Contractual Clauses into all of our Volume
Licensing agreements via the Product Terms . For personal data from the European
Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, Microsoft will ensure that



transfers of personal data to a third country/region or an international organization are
subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR. In addition to
Microsoft's commitments under the Standard Contractual Clauses for processors and
other model contracts, Microsoft continues to abide by the terms of the Privacy Shield
framework  but will no longer rely on it as a basis for the transfer of personal data
from the EU/EEA to the United States.

What are the other Microsoft compliance offerings?

As a global company with customers in nearly every country/region in the world,
Microsoft has a robust compliance portfolio to assist our customers. To view a complete
list of our compliance offerings including FedRamp, HIPAA/HITECH, ISO 27001, ISO
27002, ISO 27018, NIST 800-171, UK G-Cloud, and many others visit our compliance
offering topics.

How will GDPR affect my company?

The GDPR imposes a wide range of requirements on organizations that collect or
process personal data, including a requirement to comply with six key principles:

Transparency, fairness, and lawfulness in the handling and use of personal data. You
will need to be clear with individuals about how you are using personal data and
will also need a "lawful basis" to process that data.
Limiting the processing of personal data to specified, explicit, and legitimate
purposes. You will not be able to reuse or disclose personal data for purposes that
are not "compatible" with the purpose for which the data was originally collected.
Minimizing the collection and storage of personal data to that which is adequate
and relevant for the intended purpose.
Ensuring the accuracy of personal data and enabling it to be erased or rectified. You
will need to take steps to ensure that the personal data you hold is accurate and
can be corrected if errors occur.
Limiting the storage of personal data. You will need to ensure that you retain
personal data only for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which the
data was collected.
Ensuring security, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data. Your organization
must take steps to keep personal data secure through technical and organizational
security measures.

You will need to understand what your organization's specific obligations are to the
GDPR are and how you will meet them, though Microsoft is here to help you on your
GDPR journey.

What rights must companies enable under GDPR?



The GDPR provides EU residents with control over their personal data through a set of
'data subject rights'. This includes the right to:

Access information about how personal data is used.
Access personal data held by an organization.
Have incorrect personal data deleted or corrected.
Have personal data rectified and erased in certain circumstances (sometimes
referred to as the "right to be forgotten").
Restrict or object to automated processing of personal data.
Receive a copy of personal data.

What are Processors and Controllers?

A controller is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data. A processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other
body, which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

Does the GDPR apply to Processors and Controllers?

Yes, the GDPR applies to both controllers and processors. Controllers must only use
processors that take measures to meet the requirements of the GDPR. Under the GDPR,
processors face additional duties and liability for noncompliance, or acting outside of
instructions provided by the controller, as compared to the Data Protection Directive.
Processor duties include, but are not limited to:

Processing data only as instructed by the controller.
Using appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
Assisting the controller with data subject requests.
Ensuring subprocessors it engages meet these requirements.

How much can companies be fined for noncompliance?

Companies can be fined up to €20m or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is
greater, for failure to meet certain GDPR requirements. Additional individual remedies
could increase your risk if you fail to adhere to GDPR requirements.

Does my business need to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)?

It depends on several factors identified within the regulation. Article 37 of the GDPR
states that controllers and processors shall designate a data protection officer in any
case where: (a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for
courts acting in their judicial capacity; (b) the core activities of the controller or the
processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope



and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a
large scale; or (c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 and
personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses referred to in Article 10.

How much will it cost to meet compliance with the GDPR?

Meeting compliance with the GDPR will cost time and money for most organizations,
though it may be a smoother transition for those who are operating in a well-
architected cloud services model and have an effective data governance program in
place.

How do I know if the data that my organization is processing is covered by the GDPR?

The GDPR regulates the collection, storage, use, and sharing of 'personal data'. Personal
data is defined broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or
identifiable natural person.

Personal data can include, but is not limited to, online identifiers (for example, IP
addresses), employee information, sales databases, customer services data, customer
feedback forms, location data, biometric data, CCTV footage, loyalty scheme records,
health, and financial information and much more. It can even include information that
does not appear to be personal-such as a photo of a landscape without people-where
that information is linked by an account number or unique code to an identifiable
individual. And even personal data that has been pseudonymized can be personal data
if the pseudonym can be linked to a particular individual.

Processing of certain "special" categories of personal data, such as personal data that
reveals a person's racial or ethnic origin, or concerns their health or sexual orientation, is
subject to more stringent rules than the processing of "ordinary" personal data. This
evaluation of personal data is highly fact-specific, so we recommend engaging an expert
to evaluate your specific circumstances.

My organization is only processing data on behalf of others. Does it still need to
comply with the GDPR?

Yes. Although the rules differ somewhat, the GDPR applies to organizations that collect
and process data for their own purposes ('controllers') as well as to organizations that
process data on behalf of others ('processors'). This requirement is a shift from the
existing Data Protection Directive, which applies to controllers.

What specifically is deemed personal data?



Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. There is
no distinction between a person's private, public, or work roles. Personal data can
include:

Name
Home address
Work address
Telephone number
Mobile number
Email address
Passport number
National ID card
Social Security Number (or equivalent)
Driver's license
Physical, physiological, or genetic information
Medical information
Cultural identity
Bank details/account numbers
Tax file number
Work address
Credit/Debit card numbers
Social media posts
IP address (EU region)
Location/GPS data
Cookies

Am I allowed to transfer data outside of the EU?

Yes, however the GDPR strictly regulates transfers of personal data of European
residents to destinations outside the European Economic Area. You may need to set up
a specific legal mechanism, such as a contract, or adhere to a certification mechanism in
order to enable these transfers. Microsoft details the mechanisms we use in the Product
Terms Terms.

I have data retention requirements through compliance. Do these requirements
override the right to erasure?

Where there are legitimate grounds for continued processing and data retention, such
as 'for compliance with a legal obligation, which requires processing by Union or
Member State law to which the controller is subject' (Article 17(3)(b)), the GDPR
recognizes that organizations may be required to retain data. You should, however,
make sure you engage your legal counsel to ensure that the grounds for retention are



weighed against the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, their expectations at the
time the data was collected, etc.

Does the GDPR deal with encryption?

Encryption is identified in the GDPR as a protective measure that renders personal data
unintelligible when it is affected by a breach. Therefore, whether or not encryption is
used may impact requirements for notification of a personal data breach. The GDPR also
points to encryption as an appropriate technical or organizational measure in some
cases, depending on the risk. Encryption is also a requirement through the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard and part of the strict compliance guidelines
specific to the financial services industry. Microsoft products and services such as Azure,
Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, Office Microsoft 365, SQL Server/Azure
SQL Database, Windows 10 and Windows 11 offer robust encryption for data in transit
and data at rest.

How does the GDPR change an organization's response to personal data breaches?

The GDPR will change data protection requirements and make stricter obligations for
processors and controllers regarding notice of personal data breaches. Under the new
regulation, the processor must notify the data controller of a personal data breach, after
having become aware of it, without undue delay. Once aware of a personal data breach,
the controller must notify the relevant data protection authority within 72 hours. If the
breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals,
controllers will also need to notify impacted individuals without undue delay. Additional
guidance on this topic is being developed by the EU's Article 29 Working Party.

Microsoft products and services—such as Azure, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility +
Security, Microsoft Office 365, and Windows 10—have solutions available today to help
you detect and assess security threats and breaches and meet the GDPR's breach
notification obligations.

Microsoft's data protection officer
Article • 12/01/2024

Microsoft has designated a European Union Data Protection Officer (DPO) to be an
independent advisor for Microsoft's engineering and business groups and to help
ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and
Microsoft's corporate standards. The role was designed to meet the GDPR criteria set
out in Articles 37-39.

Qualifications
The DPO role requires successful candidates to have at least seven years of professional
data protection experience, or a mix of 10 years of data protection, security, and
enterprise risk management experience in order to be considered for the position. In
addition, candidates must have demonstrated expertise in international data protection
law and practices.

Nature of the role
The DPO is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all key issues, which relate to
the protection of personal data. This action is effectuated, in part, by the DPO's role in
reviewing and advising on all Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) generated by
Microsoft. As the DPIA program is designed to capture all personal data processing at
Microsoft, the DPO will have cross-company visibility into, and the opportunity to
inform and advise Microsoft of its obligations pursuant to the GDPR regarding
Microsoft's personal data processing. This same mechanism also allows the DPO to
monitor Microsoft's compliance with applicable data protection regulations, including
the GDPR, and Microsoft's internal policies and controls.

Position of the Data Protection Officer
The European Union DPO reports directly to Microsoft's Chief Privacy Officer, a senior
executive within Microsoft's Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has
autonomy to perform the functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the
Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer
response resources as necessary to perform the DPO functions. The DPO is bound by
confidentiality concerning their tasks by using a non-disclosure agreement.



Contact
Data subjects may contact the data protection officer by filling out the webform at
https://aka.ms/privacyresponse . The DPO can also be reached by post at:

Support your GDPR program with
Accountability Readiness Checklists
Article • 12/01/2024

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations
that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and
analyze data for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located.
Additional details are in the GDPR Summary topic.

Accountability Readiness Checklists
Accountability readiness checklists are provided to conveniently access information you
may need to support the GDPR when using Microsoft products and services. The
checklist lists potential obligations you may have under the GDPR, and points you to
information that you can use to support your organizations' compliance.

There is a specific guide for the following Microsoft product and services families:

Office 365
Dynamics 365
Azure
Windows
Microsoft Support and Professional Services

You can manage the items in this checklist with Compliance Manager by referencing the
Control ID and Control Title under Customer Managed Controls in the GDPR tile.

The checklists include the four basic categories of considerations for a privacy program
supporting GDPR listed below, along with example requirements.

1. Conditions for Data Collection and Processing:

When is consent obtained?
Identify and document purpose
Privacy impact assessment

2. Data Subject Rights

Customer agreements
Online service terms: You can find Microsoft contractual commitments with regard
to the GDPR in the Online Services Terms .
Microsoft product terms: Microsoft extends the GDPR Terms commitments  to all
Volume Licensing customers.
Data protection addendum: Microsoft services extends the commitments to
Microsoft Consulting Services customers and others.

GDPR compliance controls
Use Compliance Manager: Review and incorporate controls Microsoft uses to
support obligations in the GDPR with Compliance Manager.
GDPR control mapping: Access a comprehensive mapping  of Microsoft controls
to GDPR obligations.

Records of Processing for Processors
Due to the scale and breadth of the online services we provide as processors to our
controller customers, we expect customers to identify the services they seek the records
of processing for and retrieve the relevant logs in the online tools we provide. One
example is for the records of processing for Azure in which customers would be
requested to identify which types of processing activity they seek the records of.

Azure logs
Typically, customers would be interested in the Activity logs and potentially the
Diagnostic logs:

Activity logs: Activity logs provide insight into operations performed on resources
in a subscription. Activity logs can help determine an operation's initiator, time of



occurrence, and status.
Diagnostic logs: Diagnostic logs are all logs emitted by every resource. These logs
include Windows event system logs, Azure storage logs, Key Vault audit logs, and
Application Gateway access and firewall logs.
Log archiving: All diagnostic logs write to a centralized and encrypted Azure
storage account for archival. The retention is user-configurable, up to 730 days, to
meet organization-specific retention requirements. These logs connect to Azure
Monitor logs for processing, storing, and dashboard reporting.

Other logs
Additionally, the following monitoring solutions are installed as a part of this
architecture. It is the customer's responsibility to configure these solutions to align with
FedRAMP security controls:

AD Assessment: The Active Directory Health Check solution assesses the risk and
health of server environments on a regular interval and provides a prioritized list of
recommendations specific to the deployed server infrastructure.
Anti-malware Assessment: The Anti-malware solution reports on malware, threats,
and protection status.
Azure Automation: The Azure Automation solution stores, runs, and manages
runbooks.
Security and Audit: The Security and Audit dashboard provides a high-level insight
into the security state of resources by providing metrics on security domains,
notable issues, detections, threat intelligence, and common security queries.
SQL Assessment: The SQL Health Check solution assesses the risk and health of
server environments on a regular interval and provides customers with a prioritized
list of recommendations specific to the deployed server infrastructure.
Update Management: The Update Management solution allows customer
management of operating system security updates, including a status of available
updates and the process of installing required updates.
Agent Health: The Agent Health solution reports how many agents are deployed
and their geographic distribution, as well as how many agents that are
unresponsive and the number of agents that are submitting operational data.
Azure Activity Logs: The Activity Log Analytics solution assists with analysis of the
Azure activity logs across all Azure subscriptions for a customer.
Change Tracking: The Change Tracking solution allows customers to easily identify
changes in the environment.

For information on the technical and security measures for Azure, controller customers
should visit the Azure Security Documentation. As Microsoft doesn't know if Customer



Data is Personal Data or not, Azure processes all Customer Data as if it were Personal
Data so a customer would likely consider all of the material relevant.

Processor information
Another product our customer might need records of processing information for
processors is Office 365. To view information related to Office 365, see the Search the
audit log in the Security & Compliance Center article.

You can also view the information for Dynamics 365 using the Security & Compliance
center. In order to view the Security & Compliance center page, ensure that you have
the correct license. Learn more about licensing with the Security & Compliance Center
service description article. To search for Dynamics 365 events, visit the Unified Audit Log
in the Security & Compliance center .

Professional services information
As for Professional Services, the Professional Services Support Data is provided by the
customer to the support engineer by the customer's representative. This may take place
when a customer submits a Service Request either through the online product portal,
Services Hub or via phone.

The information is stored in our CRM systems and only used for the following purposes:

Delivering the Professional Services, including providing technical support,
professional planning, advice, guidance, data migration, deployment, and
solution/software development services.
Troubleshooting (preventing, detecting, investigating, mitigating, and repairing
problems, including Security Incidents); and
Ongoing improvement (maintaining the Professional Services, including installing
the latest updates, and making improvements to the reliability, efficacy, quality,
and security).

Due to the scale of our support operations, Microsoft operates product group-based
CRM system. Records of processing will be contained within those systems. A history of
processing is reflected in the records maintained within our CRM systems. In most
instances the Service Request History is available on the portals or Service Hub. For any
specific details that are not available on the portals or any other inquiries about
processing of your data, contact your Technical Account Manager or contact Microsoft
Technical Support .

Accountability Readiness Checklist for
Microsoft 365
Article • 12/01/2024

1. Introduction
This accountability readiness checklist provides a convenient way to access information
you may need to support the GDPR when using Microsoft Office 365.

You can manage the items in this checklist with Compliance Manager by referencing the
Control ID and Control Title under Customer Managed Controls in the GDPR tile.

In addition, items in this checklist under 5. Data Protection & Security provide references
to controls listed under Microsoft Managed Controls in the GDPR tile in Compliance
Manager. Reviewing the Microsoft Implementation Details for these controls provide
additional explanation of Microsoft's approach to fulfilling the customer considerations
in the checklist item.

The checklist and Compliance Manager are organized using the titles and reference
number (in parentheses for each checklist topic) of a set of privacy and security controls
for personal data processors drawn from:

ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy management requirements.
ISO/IEC 27001 for security techniques requirements.

This control structure is also used to organize the presentation of the internal controls
that Microsoft Office 365 implements to support GDPR, which you can download from
the Service Trust Center .

Data Subject Requests and the GDPR and
CCPA
06/25/2025

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations that
offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data
for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located. Additional details can be
found in the GDPR Summary article.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and obligations to
California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject Rights, such as the right
to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal information. The CCPA also provides
for certain disclosures, protections against discrimination when electing exercise rights, and
"opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document
guides you to information on the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR
and CCPA using Microsoft products and services.

Terminology
Helpful definitions for GDPR terms used in this document:

Data Controller (Controller): A legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
directly or indirectly.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.



Customer Data: Data produced and stored in the day-to-day operations of running your
business.

What is a DSR?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives rights to people (known in the regulation
as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has been collected by an employer or other
type of agency or organization (known as the data controller or just controller). The GDPR
gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies
of it, requesting changes to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an
electronic format so it can be moved to another controller.

As a controller, you're obligated to promptly consider each DSR and provide a substantive
response either by taking the requested action or by providing an explanation for why the DSR
can't be accommodated by the controller. A controller should consult with its own legal or
compliance advisers regarding the proper disposition of any given DSR.

Several processes may be involved completing a DSR, subject to your organization's GDPR-
compliance rules.

Discovery. The process of determining what data is needed to complete a DSR.
Access. Retrieval and potential transmission to the data subject of discovered information.
Rectify. Implement changes or other requested personal data changes.
Restrict. Changing the access or processing of personal data by restricting access, or
removing data from the Microsoft cloud.
Export. Providing a "structured, commonly used, machine-readable format" of personal
data to the data subject, as provided by the GDPR's "right of data portability."
Delete. Permanent removal of personal data from the Microsoft cloud.

Specific DSR Considerations

Insights generated by Microsoft Products or Services
Insights may be generated by services (Viva Personal Insights, etc.) Office 365 includes online
services that provide insights to users and organizations that use them. Data generated by
these services may produce personal data relevant to a DSR. Follow the link in the list below for
details regarding service-specific DSR processes.

DSRs for system-generated logs



Logs and related data generated by Microsoft may contain data deemed personal under
GDPR's definition of "personal data." Restricting or rectifying data in system-generated logs
isn't supported. Data in system-generated logs constitutes factual actions conducted within the
Microsoft cloud and diagnostic data; modifications would compromise the historical record of
actions and increase fraud and security risks. Microsoft provides the ability to access, export,
and delete system-generated logs that may be necessary to complete a DSR. Examples of such
data may include:

Product and service usage data such as user activity logs
User search requests and query data
Data generated by product and services resulting from system functionality and
interaction by users or other systems.

For more information about system-generated logs from a Data Subject Right (DSR) export,
see Overview of system-generated logs from a Data Subject Request (DSR) export.

Viva Engage
Deleting a user's account won't remove system-generated logs for Viva Engage. To remove the
data from these applications, see one of the following resources:

Manage GDPR data subject requests in Viva Engage

National Clouds
In some national clouds, a global IT Administrator needs to delete system-generated logs.

Microsoft Services
If your organization or users engage with Microsoft to receive support related to Microsoft
products and services, some of this data may contain personal data. For more information, see
Microsoft Support and Professional Services Data Subject Requests for the GDPR.

Microsoft Controller Products
In some circumstances, your organization's users may access Microsoft products or services for
which Microsoft is the data controller. In those cases, your users need to initiate their own
DSRs directly to Microsoft, and Microsoft fulfills the requests directly to the user.

Third-party Products



For third-party products and services accessed through Microsoft account authentication, any
data subject requests should be directed to the applicable third party.

Data Subject Request admin tools
Microsoft portals: Export user authored or generated data using the Microsoft Purview
portal , the Microsoft Purview portal , or using in-application features.
Microsoft Entra Admin Center: Delete a data subject from Microsoft Entra ID and related
services using Microsoft Entra Admin Center .
Microsoft Data Log Export: System-generated logs can be exported by tenant
administrators using the Microsoft Data Log Export .

Azure Data Subject Requests for the
GDPR and CCPA
Article • 12/01/2024

Introduction to Data Subject Requests (DSRs)
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has
been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the
data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as
any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data
subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of
personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or
receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal
request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is
called a Data Subject Request or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

The guide discusses how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to
help our controller customers find and act on personal data to respond to DSRs.
Specifically, this information includes how to find, access, and act on personal data that
reside in the Microsoft cloud. Here's a quick overview of the processes outlined in this
guide:

Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that
may be the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected,
you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps
to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that the request
doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested,
make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.



Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data,
where applicable.
Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for
various Azure services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can
also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another
location.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in the Microsoft cloud.
Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable
format) of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Each section in this guide outlines the technical procedures that a data controller
organization can take to respond to a DSR for personal data in the Microsoft cloud.

Terminology
The following provides definitions of terms that are relevant to this guide.

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and
software, that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, a customer through
use of the enterprise service. Customer Data includes both (1) identifiable
information of end users (for example, user names and contact information in
Microsoft Entra ID) and Customer Content that a customer uploads into or creates
in specific services (for example, customer content in an Azure Storage account,
customer content of an Azure SQL Database, or a customer's virtual machine
image in Azure Virtual Machines).
System-Generated Logs: Logs and related data generated by Microsoft that help
Microsoft provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain
primarily pseudonymized data, such as unique identifiers—typically a number



generated by the system that can't on its own identify an individual person but is
used to deliver the enterprise services to users. System-generated logs may also
contain identifiable information about end users, such as a username.

How to use this guide
This guide consists of two parts:

Part 1: Responding to Data Subject Requests for Customer Data: Part 1 of this
guide discusses how to access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export data from
applications in which you have authored data. This section details how to execute
DSRs against both Customer Content and also identifiable information of end
users.
Part 2: Responding to Data Subject Requests for System-Generated Logs: When
you use Microsoft's enterprise services, Microsoft generates some information,
known as System-Generated Logs, in order to provide the service. Part 2 of this
guide discusses how to access, delete, and export such information for Azure.

Understanding DSRs for Microsoft Entra ID and
Microsoft service accounts
By using the Extended Directory Direct Token (EDDT), guest users within a tenant are
able to initiate DSRs across multiple tenants. Any user-initiated DSRs is executed against
all the tenants where the user is authorized by the corresponding tenant administrator.

The same also applies for Microsoft Service Accounts (MSA) within the context of
services provided to an enterprise customer: execution of a DSR against an MSA account
associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant will only pertain to data within the tenant. In
addition, it's important to understand the following when handling MSA accounts within
a tenant:

If an MSA user creates an Azure subscription, the subscription is handled as if it
were a Microsoft Entra tenant. Consequently, DSRs are scoped within the tenant as
described above.
If an Azure subscription created via an MSA account is deleted, it will not affect
the actual MSA account. Again, as noted above, DSRs executing within the Azure
subscription are limited to the scope of the tenant itself.

DSRs against an MSA account itself, outside a given tenant, are executed via the
Consumer Privacy Dashboard .



Part 1: DSR Guide for customer data

Executing DSRs against customer data
Microsoft provides the ability to access, delete, and export certain Customer Data
through the Azure portal and also directly via preexisting application programming
interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services (also referred to as in-
product experiences). Details regarding such in-product experiences are described in the
respective services' reference documentation.

） Important

Services supporting in-product DSRs require direct usage of the service's
application programming interface (API) or user interface (UI), describing applicable
CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. The execution of DSRs within a
given service must be done in addition to execution of a DSR within the Azure
Portal in order to complete a full request for a given data subject. Please refer to
specific services' reference documentation for further details.

Step 1: Discover
The first step in responding to a DSR is to find the personal data that is the subject of
the request. This first step—finding and reviewing the personal data at issue—will help
you determine whether a DSR meets your organization's requirements for honoring or
declining a DSR. For example, after finding and reviewing the personal data at issue, you
may determine the request doesn't meet your organization's requirements because
doing so may adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

After you find the data, you can then perform the specific action to satisfy the request
by the data subject.

DSR managed through Azure portal
Microsoft Entra ID  is Microsoft's cloud-based, multitenant directory and identity
management service. You can locate identifiable information of end users, such as
customer and employee user profiles and user work information that contain personal
data in your Microsoft Entra ID  environment by using the Azure portal .

This is helpful if you want to find or change personal data for a specific user. You can
also add or change user profile and work information. You must sign in with an account



that's a global admin for the directory.

How do I locate or view user profile and work information?
1. Sign in to the Azure portal  with an account that's a global admin for the

directory.

2. Select Microsoft Entra ID.

3. Select Users.

4. On the All users blade, select a user from the list, and then, on the blade for the
selected user, select Properties to view user profile information that might contain
personal data.

5. If you need to add or change user profile information, you can do so by selecting
Edit Properties in the command bar, then select Save after making changes.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Step 2: Access
After you've found Customer Data containing personal data that is potentially
responsive to a DSR, it's up to you and your organization to decide which data to
provide to the data subject. You can provide them with a copy of the actual document,
an appropriately redacted version, or a screenshot of the portions you have deemed
appropriate to share. For each of these responses to an access request, you have to
retrieve a copy of the document or other item that contains the responsive data.

When providing a copy to the data subject, you may have to remove or redact personal
information about other data subjects and any confidential information.

DSR managed through Azure portal
Microsoft offers both a portal and in-product experiences providing the enterprise
customer's tenant administrator the capability to manage DSR access requests. DSR



Access requests allow for access of the personal data of the user, including: (a)
identifiable information about an end-user and (b) system-generated logs.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Step 3: Rectify
If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your
organization's data, you and your organization have to determine whether it's
appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying the data may include taking actions such as
editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type or item.

DSR managed through Azure portal
Enterprise customers have the ability to manage DSR rectify requests, including limited
editing features per the nature of a given Microsoft service. As a data processor,
Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to correct system-generated logs as it reflects factual
activities and constitutes a historical record of events within Microsoft services. With
respect to Microsoft Entra ID, limited editing features exist to rectify identifiable
information about an end-user, as described further below.

Microsoft Entra ID: rectify/correct inaccurate or incomplete
personal data

You can correct, update, or delete identifiable information about end users, like
customer and employee user profiles and user work information that contain personal
data, such as a user's name, work title, address, or phone number, in your Microsoft
Entra ID  environment by using the Azure portal . You must sign in with an account
that's assigned to a global admin role for the directory.

How do I correct or update user profile and work information in
Microsoft Entra ID?

1. Sign in to the Azure portal  with an account that's a global admin for the
directory.

2. Select Microsoft Entra ID.



3. Expand the Manage tab and select Users.
4. On the All users blade, select a user from the list, and on the blade for the selected

user, select Properties to view the user profile information that needs to be
corrected or updated.

5. Correct or update the user profile information including work information by
selecting Edit Properties in the command bar, then select Save after making
changes.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Step 4: Restrict
Data subjects may request that you restrict processing of their personal data. We
provide both the Azure portal and preexisting application programming interfaces (APIs)
or user interfaces (UIs). These experiences provide the enterprise customer's tenant
administrator the capability to manage such DSRs through a combination of data export
and data deletion. A customer may (1) export an electronic copy of the personal data of
the user, including (a) accounts, (b) system-generated logs, and (c) associated logs,
followed with (2) deletion of the account and associated data residing within Microsoft
systems.

Step 5: Delete
The "right to erasure" by the removal of personal data from an organization's Customer
Data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes removing all
personal data and system-generated logs, except audit log information. When a user is
soft deleted (see details below), the account is disabled for 30 days. If no further action
is taken during this 30-day period, the user is permanently deleted (again, see details
below). Upon a permanent delete, the user's account, personal data, and system-
generated logs are expunged within an additional 30 days. If a tenant admin
immediately issues a permanent delete, the user's account, personal data, and system-
generated logs are expunged within 30 days of issuance.

） Important



You must be a tenant administrator to delete a user from the tenant.

Delete a user and associated data through the Azure portal
After you receive a delete request for a data subject, you can use the Azure portal to
delete both a user and the associated personal information and system-generated logs.

Deleting this data also means deleting the user from the tenant. Users are initially soft-
deleted, which means the account can be recovered by a tenant admin within 30 days of
being marked for soft-delete. After 30 days, the account is automatically, and
permanently, deleted from the tenant. Prior to that 30 days, you can manually delete a
soft-deleted user from the recycle bin.

To delete a user from an Azure tenant

1. Sign in to the Azure portal  with an account that's a global admin for the
directory.

2. Select Microsoft Entra ID.
3. Expand the Manage Tab and select Users.
4. Check the box next to the user you want to delete, select Delete user, and then

select Yes in the box asking if you want to delete the user.
5. On the All users blade, expand the Manage tab and select Deleted users.
6. Select the same user again, select Delete permanently in the command bar, and

then select Yes in the box asking if you're sure.

） Important

Be aware that by clicking Yes you are permanently, and irrevocably, deleting the
user and all associated data and system-generated logs. If you do this by mistake,
you'll have to manually add the user back to the tenant. The associated data and
system-generated logs are non-recoverable.

Delete a user's data when there's no account in the Azure tenant

While some users have an account in your Azure tenant that you're able to delete,
business-to-business (B2B) direct connect users don't. B2B direct connect users use their
native identities to receive cross-tenant access to the apps and resources hosted in your
tenant. They use the user account hosted in their home tenant without requiring a guest
account in your tenant.



To honor the DSR for these users, you'll delete the personal data associated with the
user in your tenant instead of the user account itself.

1. Open the Azure portal, select All services, type policy into the filter, and then select
Policy.

2. In the Policy blade, select User privacy, select Manage User Requests, and then
select Add delete request.

3. Complete the New delete data request:

User: Type the email address of the Microsoft Entra ID user that requested
the delete.

4. Select Delete.

The delete request goes into Pending status. You can review the report status on the
User privacy > Overview blade.

） Important

Because personal data can come from multiple systems, the delete process may
take up to one month to complete.

For more information on deleting users, bulk deleting users, and deleting tenants from
Entra ID, see the following guidance:

How to create or delete users in Microsoft Entra ID
Delete a Microsoft Entra tenant
Bulk delete users in Microsoft Entra ID

DSR delete managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Step 6: Export
The "right of data portability" allows a data subject to request a copy of their personal
data in an electronic format (that's a "structured, commonly used, machine read-able,
and interoperable format") that may be transmitted to another data controller. Azure



supports this by enabling your organization to export the data in the native JSON
format, to your specified Azure Storage Container.

） Important

You must be a tenant administrator to export user data from the tenant.

DSR managed through Azure portal
With respect to Customer Data, Microsoft offers both a portal and in-product
experiences providing the enterprise customer's tenant administrator the capability to
manage export requests for identifiable information about an end user.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Part 2: System-Generated Logs
Microsoft also provides tenant administrators with the ability to perform a DSR to
access, delete, and export specific system-generated logs as a tenant administrator.

） Important

The ability to restrict or rectify system-generated logs is not supported. System-
generated logs constitute factual actions conducted within the Microsoft cloud and
diagnostic data, and modifications to such data would compromise the historical
record of actions, increasing fraud and security risks.

Executing DSRs against System-Generated Logs
Tenant administrators can execute a DSR for specific system-generated logs through the
Azure portal and also directly via programmatic user interfaces for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation.

） Important



Services supporting in-product DSRs require direct usage of the service's
application programming interface (API) or user interface (UI). Execution of an in-
product DSR must be done in addition to execution of a DSR within the Azure
Portal in order to complete a full request for a given data subject. Please refer to
specific services' reference documentation for further details.

Step 1: Access
The tenant admin is the only person within your organization who can execute a data
subject request related to the personal data captured in systems-generated logs. The
data retrieved for an access request will be provided in a machine-readable format and
will be provided in files that allow the user to know which services the data is associated
with. As noted above, the data retrieved won't include data that may compromise the
security of the service.

DSR access for systems-generated logs managed through
Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft offers both a portal and in-product experiences providing the enterprise
customer's tenant administrator the capability to manage access requests. Access
requests allow for access of the personal data of the user, including: (a) identifiable
information about an end user and (b) service-generated logs. The process is identical
to that described in the Microsoft Entra ID section of Part 1, Step 2: Access.

DSR access for systems-generated logs managed through service
APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Step 2: Delete
The tenant admin is the only person within your organization who can execute a DSR
delete request for a particular user within an Azure tenant.

DSR managed through Azure portal



Microsoft offers both a portal and in-product experiences providing the enterprise
customer's tenant administrator the capability to manage DSR delete requests. DSR
delete requests follow the same as described in the Delete a user and associated data
through the Azure portal section of Part 1, Step 5: Delete.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

DSR delete for a guest in a tenant
All guests are able to see which organizations they can collaborate with at My Account -
Organizations (microsoft.com) .

If a user selects Leave:

When a B2B collaboration user leaves an organization, the user's account is soft deleted
in the directory. By default, the user object moves to the Deleted users area in Microsoft
Entra ID, but permanent deletion doesn't start for 30 days. This soft deletion enables the
administrator to restore the user account, including groups and permissions, if the user
makes a request to restore the account before it's permanently deleted.

If desired, a tenant administrator can permanently delete the account at any time during
the soft-deleted period with the following steps. This action is irrevocable.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center  as a External Identity Provider
administrator.

2. Browse to Identity > Users >All users. 1. Select Deleted users. 1. Select the check
box for a deleted user and select Delete permanently.

Permanent deletion can be initiated by the admin, or it automatically occurs at the end
of the soft deletion period. Permanent deletion can take up to an extra 30 days for data
removal.

For B2B direct connect users, data removal begins as soon as the user selects Leave in
the confirmation message and can take up to 30 days to complete.

Step 3: Export



The tenant admin is the only person within your organization who can execute a data
subject request related to personal data captured in system-generated logs. The data
retrieved for an export request will be provided in a machine-readable format and will
be provided in files that allow the user to know which services the data is associated
with. As noted above, the data retrieved won't include data that may compromise the
security or stability of the service.

DSR managed through the Azure portal
After you receive an export request for a data subject, you can use the admin portal to
download logs. For more information on downloading logs within the portal, see: How
to download logs in Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn

Tenant administrators can also export system-generated logs via the Microsoft Data Log
Export . Tenant administrators should select “Add export request” and fill in the
following fields:

User Type: Select if the user a B2B collaboration user or a B2B direct connect user.
User: Type the email address of the Microsoft Entra ID user that requested the
export.
Azure Subscription: Select the account you use to report resource usage and to
bill for services. This is also the location of your Azure storage account.
Storage account: Select the location of your Azure Storage (Blob), select Create.
For more information, see Introduction to Microsoft Azure Storage—Blob storage.

The export request goes into Pending status. You can view the report status on the User
privacy—Overview blade.

） Important

Because personal data can come from multiple systems, the export process may
take up to one month to complete.

DSR managed through service APIs
Microsoft provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via preexisting
application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services.
Details are described in the respective services' reference documentation, describing
applicable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Azure DevOps Services Data Subject
Requests for the GDPR and CCPA
Article • 03/07/2025

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people, known in the regulation as data subjects, to manage the personal data that's
collected by a data controller. A data controller, or just controller, is an employer or other
type of agency or organization. Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as any
data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data
subjects specific rights to their personal data. These rights include obtaining copies of
personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or
receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal
request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is
called a Data Subject Request, or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

For general information about GDPR, see the GDPR section of the Service Trust portal .

This guide discusses how to use Microsoft tools to export or delete personal data
collected during an authenticated (signed-in) session of Azure DevOps Services
(formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services).

Additional privacy information
The Microsoft Privacy Statement , Online Services Terms (OST) , and Microsoft's
GDPR Commitments articles describe our data processing practices.

Personal data we collect
Microsoft collects data from users to operate and improve Azure DevOps Services.
Azure DevOps Services collects two categories of data — customer data and system-



generated logs. Customer data includes user-identifiable transactional and interactional
data that Azure DevOps Services needs to operate the service. System-generated logs
include service usage data that is aggregated for each product area and feature.

Delete Azure DevOps data
Azure DevOps, as a system for managing changes, must comply with strict rules for data
integrity, traceability, and auditing. These obligations influence our responsibilities for
data deletion and retention under GDPR, and for this reason, we do not fulfill individual
requests for anonymizaton or deletion. The only method to eliminate personal data
from Azure DevOps is by completely deleting the organization. Terminating the
Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft Account (MSA) identity account does not alter or delete
any artifacts or records associated with the individual identity within the Azure DevOps
organization, for example, your pull requests or work items. We've ensured that when
you delete an Azure DevOps organization, all associated personal data gets removed
and system-generated logs get anonymized after the compulsory 30-day soft-delete
timeframe.

Export Azure DevOps data
Controllers can export customer data and system-generated logs collected from their
data subjects by one of two methods, depending upon the identity provider (MSA or
Microsoft Entra ID) used to sign in to the Azure DevOps service.

Users that authenticate using an account that is backed by an Azure tenant, for
example, Microsoft Entra account or MSA account associated with an Azure
subscription, can follow the instructions in Azure Data Subject Requests for the
GDPR.

Users that authenticate using an MSA identity can use this Privacy Request site
to view activity data tied to their MSA identity across multiple Microsoft services. In
this scenario, the user is a controller for their own personal data.

Export or delete issues
For Microsoft Entra identities, if you run into issues while exporting or deleting data
from the Azure portal, go to the Azure portal Help + Support blade and submit a new
ticket under Subscription Management > Privacy and compliance requests for
Subscriptions > Privacy Blade and GDPR Requests.



For MSA identities, if you run into issues while exporting data from the Privacy Request
site, log on to the Privacy Request site  and submit a request for help from the
Microsoft Privacy team via the request webform.

Learn more
Microsoft is committed to ensuring that your Azure DevOps Services data remains
secure and private, without exception. Visit the Azure DevOps Services data protection
overview whitepaper to learn more about how we protect your Azure DevOps Services
data.

Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Data
Subject Requests for the GDPR and
CCPA
Article • 12/19/2024

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has
been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the
data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as
any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data
subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of it,
requesting changes to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it and
transmitting it to another controller. A formal request by a data subject to a controller to
take action on their personal data is called in this document a Data Subject Rights
Request or DSR request.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

The guide discusses how to use Microsoft's products, services, and administrative tools
to help our controller customers find and act on personal data to respond to DSR
requests. Specifically, this includes how to find, access, and act on personal data or
personal information that reside in Microsoft's cloud. Here's a quick overview of the
processes outlined in this guide:

Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer- data that
may be the subject of a DSR request. Once potentially responsive documents are
collected, you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the
following steps to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that
the request doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSR
requests.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested,
make a copy of it that is available to the data subject.



Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data,
where applicable.
Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for
various online services or turning off the desired services where possible.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in Microsoft's cloud.
Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable
format) of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Each section in this guide outlines the technical procedures that a data controller
organization can take to respond to a DSR request for personal data in Microsoft's
cloud.

GDPR terminology
The following list provides definitions of terms that are relevant to this guide:

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and
software, that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, a customer through
use of the enterprise service. Customer Data includes both (1) identifiable
information of end users (for example, user names and contact information in
Microsoft Entra ID) and Customer Content that a customer uploads into or creates
in specific services (for example, customer content in an Azure Storage account,
customer content of an Azure SQL Database, or a customer's virtual machine
image in Azure Virtual Machines).
System-Generated Logs: Logs and related data generated by Microsoft that help
Microsoft provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain
primarily pseudonymized data, such as unique identifiers—typically a number



generated by the system that can't on its own identify an individual person but is
used to deliver the enterprise services to users.

How this guide can help you meet your
controller responsibilities
The guide, divided into two parts, describes how to use Dynamics 365 products,
services, and administrative tools to help you find and act on data in the Microsoft cloud
in response to requests by data subjects who are exercising their rights under the GDPR.
The first part addresses personal data that is included in customer data, followed by a
part addressing other pseudonymized personal data captured in system-generated logs.

Part 1: Responding to Data Subject Rights (DSR) requests for Personal Data
included in Customer Data: Part 1 of this guide discusses how to access, rectify,
restrict, delete, and export personal data from Dynamics 365 applications (software
as a service), which is processed as part of the customer data you have provided to
the online service.
Part 2: Responding to data subject rights requests for Pseudonymized Data:
When you use Dynamics 365 enterprise services, Microsoft generates some
information (referred to within this document as system-generated logs) to provide
the service, which is limited to the usage footprint left behind by end users to
identify their actions in the system. Although this data can't be attributed to a
specific data subject without the use of additional information, some of it may be
deemed personal under the GDPR. Part 2 of this guide discusses how to access,
delete, and export system-generated logs produced by Dynamics 365.

Preparing for data subject rights investigations
When data subjects exercise their rights and make requests, consider the following
points:

Properly identify the person and role—such as employee, customer, vendor—by
using information that the data subject gave you as part of his or her request. This
information might be a name, an employee ID or customer number, or another
identifier.
Record the date and time of the request. (You have 1 month to complete the
request.)
Affirm that the request meets your organization's requirements for honoring or
declining a data subject's request. For example, you must make sure that executing



the request doesn't conflict with any other legal, financial, or regulatory obligations
that you have, or infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.
Verify that you have the information that is related to the request.

Part 1: Responding to Data Subject Rights
Requests for personal data included in
customer data
In the following articles, you'll find information to help you prepare for and respond to
DSR requests for personal data included in Customer Data processed in Dynamics 365.
It's important to note that personal data could be present in other categories of data
processed by Microsoft during the course of the service of an online services
subscription, such as administrator data or Professional Services data. This document is
limited to assisting you in the process of discovery and management of DSR requests
affecting personal data present in the customer data that you have provided to
Dynamics 365.

Dynamics 365 is a set of online services that offers multiple data processing capabilities
as a software-as-a-service (SaaS). As such, Dynamics 365 offers a broad array of
functionality intended to process a diverse collection of data, which could vary by
nature, purpose or other specific attributes, such as sales data, transactions, financials,
HR information, etc. In light of this diversity, Dynamics 365 offers multiple forms, fields,
schemas, end points, and logic to process customer data, which is also reflected in the
multiple ways in which DSR requests could be addressed in each application. When
Dynamics 365 applications offer several ways to address specific DSR requests, we'll
note those in this guide by pointing to the technical descriptions offered by each
application.

Dynamics 365

Finding Customer Data
The first step in responding to a data subject rights request is to search for and identify
the customer data that is the subject of the request.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Sales,
Dynamics 365 Project Operations & Dynamics 365 Customer Insights are referenced
collectively as "customer engagement applications" in this document. Dynamics 365
Guides & Dynamics 365 Remote Assist are referenced collectively as "mixed reality
applications" in this document. Classifying customer data appropriately is the



cornerstone of working with personal data in customer engagement business
applications. Customer engagement applications offer flexibility to build out an
application extension around data classification. Proper classification enables you to
identify information as personal data, thereby making it possible to locate and retrieve it
when responding to requests from a data subject. It can also help enable compliance
with legislative and regulatory requirements for collecting and managing personal data.

Microsoft provides capabilities that assist you in responding to data subject rights
requests, and thereby accessing customer data. However, it is your responsibility to
ensure that personal data is located and classified appropriately.

Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications and mixed reality applications (as
previously referenced) provide multiple methods for you to search for personal data
within records such as: Advanced Find Search and Search for Records. These functions
all enable you to identify (find) personal data.

Advanced Find Search
Search for Records across multiple record types

In Dynamics 365 for Customer Insights - Journeys, you have the additional capability to
utilize the Insight Views on contacts or leads to identify additional data points such as
marketing interactions.

Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Human Resources,
Dynamics 365 Project Operations and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management
provide several ways for you to search for customer data. You as a Tenant Admin can
perform the following actions to search for customer data:

Organize your customer data in a way that serves the purpose of rapidly
discovering personal data, see how to classify data inventory for this purpose.
Use the Person search report to find and collect personal data.
Extend the Person search report by authoring a new entity or extending an existing
entity.
Use search and filter features to find specific personal data and export that data by
using the Microsoft Office Export functionality or print that information to a .pdf
using browser extensions.
Author a custom form that locates and exports personal data.
Author an external portal or website that allows an authenticated customer to see
his or her personal data.

If you are using the Dynamics 365 Commerce eCommerce add-ons listed below, refer to
the following resources for additional DSR processes.

Site Builder

Dynamics 365 Business Central provides several ways for you to search for customer
data. For details, see Searching, filtering, and sorting data.

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice provides several ways for you to search for customer
data. For details, see Discover data.

Providing a copy of Customer Data
Customer data in Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications and mixed reality
applications (as previously referenced) can be exported using the comprehensive entity
export capabilities. Customer data can be exported to a static Excel file to facilitate a
data portability request. Using Excel, you can then edit the personal data to be included
in the portability request and then save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format
such as .csv or .xml. Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications records also can
be exported via the Microsoft Dataverse Web API.

Additionally, for Dynamics 365 for Customer Journeys - Insights a dedicated API is
provided that allows customers to build extensions that retrieve additional records of
captured customer interactions that may contain personal data. The API loads all the
relevant information from the back-end system and assembles it into a single, portable
document.

Customer data in Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365
Human Resources, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management can be exported
using the comprehensive entity export capabilities. Using Data management and
integration entities, the Tenant Admin may utilize provided entities, create new, or
extend existing, entities for repeatable personal data export to Excel or a number of
other common formats using Data import and export jobs. Alternatively, many lists can
be exported to a static Excel file to facilitate a data portability request. When customer
data is exported to Excel, you can then edit the personal data to be included in the
portability request and then save the file as a commonly used, machine-readable format
such as .csv or .xml. You may also consider using the Person search report to provide the
data subject with data that you've classified as personal data.

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can make use of two features to provide a copy
of customer data to a data subject:

You can export customer data to an Excel file. In Excel, you can then edit the customer
data to be included in the portability request, and save it in a commonly used, machine-
readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For details, see Exporting your business data to
Excel.



In Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, you can export survey questions, invitations, and
responses to an Excel file. In Excel, you can then edit the data to be included in the
portability request, and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as
.csv or .xml. For details, see Exporting your survey data to Excel.

Rectifying customer data
Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications and mixed reality applications gives
you the following methods for correcting inaccurate or incomplete customer data, or
erasing customer data:

Search for customer data using the capabilities mentioned in "Finding customer
data" and directly edit data in customer engagement applications. Edits can be
done at a single row level or multiple rows can be modified directly.
Bulk editing multiple customer engagement applications records, you can utilize
the Microsoft Office add-in to export data to Microsoft Excel, make your changes,
and then import that modified data from Excel into customer engagement
applications.

In Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics Human Resources, and
Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you may also use customization tools, but
the decision and implementation are your responsibility.

Dynamics 365 Business Central offers two ways to correct inaccurate or incomplete
customer data.

To quickly bulk-edit multiple Business Central records, you can export lists to Excel using
the Business Central Excel Add-in to correct multiple records, and then publish the
modified data from Excel in Business Central. For details, see Exporting your Business
Data to Excel.

You can change customer data stored in any field—such as information about a
customer in the Customer card—by manually editing the data element containing the
target personal data. For details, see Entering data.

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice offers ability to modify Projects and Survey related data.
For more details, see Manage my projects & Manage my surveys.

Brief note about modifying entries in business transactions
Transactional records, such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries, are essential to
the integrity of an enterprise resource planning system. Personal data that is part of a
financial or other transaction is kept "as is" for compliance with financial laws (for



example, tax laws), prevention of fraud (such as security audit trail), or compliance with
industry certifications. Therefore, Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance,
Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, and
Dynamics 365 Business Central restrict modifying data in such records.

For Dynamics 365 Business Central, if you store personal data in business transaction
records, the only way to correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data to honor
a data subject's request is to use the customization capabilities. The decision to honor a
modification data subject request and implementation thereof is your responsibility.

Restricting the processing of customer data
When you receive a request from a data subject to restrict processing of customer data,
you can easily extract the affected customer data from the online service and store it in
a separate container (that is, on-premises storage or separate web service with data
isolation capabilities) isolated from the processing functions offered by any cloud
application.

Alternative mechanisms such as data processing block are offered by Dynamics 365
Business Central, where users are offered the ability to block specific data subject's
record. For details, see Restrict data processing for a data subject. When a record is
marked as blocked, Dynamics 365 Business Central discontinues processing the
customer data of that data subject. You can't create new transactions that use a blocked
record; for example, you can't create a new invoice for a customer, when either the
customer or salesperson is blocked.

Deleting customer data
In Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications, when a data subject asks you to
delete their customer data, there are several ways to do so:

Bulk editing multiple Dynamics 365 records, you can utilize the Microsoft Office
add-in to export data to Microsoft Excel, make your changes, and then import that
modified data from Excel back into the online service.
You can delete customer data stored in any field by locating the data you want to
delete and then manually deleting the data element containing the target
customer data, for example like employing a hard delete on the contact record
representing the data subject and other records that contain personal data.

Additionally, for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, deletion of a contact
ensures that outbound marketing interaction data with personal information is removed
as well. For any custom fields or entities, you must customize your system to make sure



it deletes all customer data from related records and/or unlinks them from the contact
record so that all personal information is removed. Customers using the real-time
marketing module should take an additional step to delete marketing interaction data.

Alternatively, in Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, and Dynamics 365
Supply Chain Management you may use customization tools to erase/modify customer
data.

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, when a data subject asks you to delete their personal
data that happens to be included in your customer data, there are several ways to
address this request:

To quickly bulk-edit multiple Business Central records, you can export data to Excel
using the Business Central Excel Add-in to delete multiple records, and then
publish these changes from Excel back in Business Central. For details, see
Exporting your Business Data to Excel.
You can delete customer data stored in any field by manually deleting the data
element containing the target customer data. For details, see Entering data.
You can directly delete customer data, for example by deleting a contact and then
running the Delete Canceled Interaction Log Entries batch job to delete
interactions for that contact.
You can delete documents containing customer data—for example, memos and
posted sales and purchase invoices.

Besides bulk or individual deletion of discrete records, please note that only terminated
workers can be fully deleted from Dynamics 365 for Human Resources. Follow these
steps to delete terminated workers.

In Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, data deletion requests can be addressed in the
following ways:

Delete the project. If the project is deleted, all its surveys and their questions,
invitations, and responses are deleted permanently.
Delete a specific survey. If the survey is deleted, all its questions, invitations, and
responses are deleted permanently.

For more details, see Deleting your survey data.

Exporting customer data
To respond to a data portability request, customer data in Dynamics 365 customer
engagement applications and mixed reality applications can be exported using the
comprehensive entity export capabilities. Customer data can be exported to a static



Excel file to facilitate a data portability request. Using Excel, you can then edit the
personal data to be included in the portability request and then save in a commonly
used, machine-readable format such as .csv or .xml.

Additionally, for Dynamics 365 for Customer Insights - Journeys a dedicated API is
provided that allows customer to build extensions that retrieve additional records of
captured customer interactions that may contain personal data. The API loads all the
relevant information from the back-end system and assembles it into a single, portable
document.

Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, and
Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management offers Data management and integration
entities that enables provided entities, newly created entities, or extended entities for a
repeatable personal data export to Excel or a number of other common formats using
Data import and export jobs. Alternatively, many lists can be exported to a static Excel
file to facilitate a data portability request. When customer data is exported to Excel in
this fashion, you can then edit the personal data to be included in the portability request
and then save the file as a commonly used, machine-readable format such as .csv or
.xml.

Both Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 Human Resources
offer Person search report to provide the data subject with data that you've classified as
personal data.

Dynamics 365 Business Central offers the following features:

You can export customer data to an Excel file. In Excel, you can then edit the
customer data to be included in the portability request, and save it in a commonly
used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For details, see Exporting your
business data to Excel.

Part 2: Responding to DSRs for system-
generated logs
Microsoft also provides you with the ability to access, export, and delete system-
generated logs that may be deemed personal under the GDPR's broad definition of
"personal data." Examples of system-generated logs that may be deemed personal
under GDPR include:

Product and service usage data such as user activity logs
User search requests and query data
Data generated by product and services as a product of system functionality and
interaction by users or other systems

The ability to restrict or rectify data in system-generated logs is not supported. Data in
system-generated logs constitutes factual actions conducted within the Microsoft cloud
and diagnostic data, and modifications to such data would compromise the historical
record of actions and increase fraud and security risks.

Accessing and exporting system-generated logs



Tenant administrators can access system-generated logs associated with a particular
user's use of Dynamics 365 services and applications. System-generated logs can be
exported by tenant administrators using the Microsoft Data Log Export. Details can be
found on the Data Subject Requests for the GDPR page of the Microsoft Trust Center,
under DSR admin tools, select Learn more about the Data Log Export.

After you create a new request, it will be listed on the Manage User Requests page
within the Azure portal where you can track its status. After a request is complete, you
can select a link to access the system-generated logs, which will be exported to your
organization's Azure Storage location within 30 days of creating the request. The data is
saved in common, machine-readable file formats such as JSON or XML. If you don't
have an Azure account and Azure Storage location, you'll need to create an Azure
account and/or Azure Storage location for your organization so that the Data Log Export
tool can export the system-generated logs.

Intune Data Subject Requests for the
GDPR and CCPA
Article • 03/07/2025

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has
been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the
data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as
any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data
subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of
personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or
receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal
request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is
called a Data Subject Request or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

The guide discusses how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to
help our controller customers find and act on personal data to respond to DSRs.
Specifically, this guidance includes how to find, access, and act on personal data or
personal information that reside in the Microsoft cloud. Here's a quick overview of the
processes outlined in this guide:

Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that
may be the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected,
you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps
to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that the request
doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested,
make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.
Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data,
where applicable.



Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for
various Azure services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can
also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another
location.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in the Microsoft cloud.
Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable
format) of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Each section in this guide outlines the technical procedures that a data controller
organization can take to respond to a DSR for personal data in the Microsoft cloud.

Terminology
The following list provides definitions of terms that are relevant to this guide.

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and
software, that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, a customer through
use of the enterprise service. Customer Data includes both (1) identifiable
information of end users (for example, user names and contact information in
Microsoft Entra ID) and Customer Content that a customer uploads into or creates
in specific services (for example, customer content in an Azure Storage account,
customer content of an Azure SQL Database, or a customer's virtual machine
image in Azure Virtual Machines).
System-Generated Logs: Logs and related data generated by Microsoft that help
Microsoft provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain
primarily pseudonymized data, such as unique identifiers—typically a number
generated by the system that cannot on its own identify an individual person but is



used to deliver the enterprise services to users. System-generated logs may also
contain identifiable information about end users, such as a user name.

How to use this guide
This guide consists of two parts:

Part 1: Responding to Data Subject Requests for Customer Data: Part 1 of this
guide discusses how to access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export data from
applications in which you have authored data. This section details how to execute
DSRs against both Customer Content and also identifiable information of end
users.
Part 2: Responding to Data Subject Requests for System-Generated Logs: When
you use Microsoft's enterprise services, Microsoft generates some information,
known as System-Generated Logs, in order to provide the service. Part 2 of this
guide discusses how to access, delete, and export such information for Azure.

Understanding DSRs for Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft
Intune
When considering services provided to enterprise customers, execution of DSRs must
always be understood within the context of a specific Microsoft Entra tenant. Notably,
DSRs are always executed within a given Microsoft Entra tenant. If a user is participating
in multiple tenants, it is important to emphasize that a given DSR is only executed within
the context of the specific tenant the request was received within. This context is critical
to understand as it means the execution of a DSR by one enterprise customer will not
impact the data of an adjacent enterprise customer.

The same also applies for Microsoft Intune provided to an enterprise customer:
execution of a DSR against an Intune account associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant
will only pertain to data within the tenant. In addition, it is important to understand the
following when handling Intune accounts within a tenant:

If an Intune user creates an Azure subscription, the subscription will be handled as
if it were a Microsoft Entra tenant. Consequently, DSRs are scoped within the
tenant as described previously.
If an Azure subscription created via an Intune account is deleted, it will not affect
the actual Intune account. Again, as noted previously, DSRs executing within the
Azure subscription are limited to the scope of the tenant itself.

DSRs against an Intune account itself, outside a given tenant, are executed via the
Consumer Privacy Dashboard. Refer to the Windows Data Subject Request Guide for



further details.

Part 1: DSR Guide for Customer Data

Executing DSRs against Customer Data
Microsoft provides the ability to access, delete, and export certain Customer Data
through the Azure portal and also directly via pre-existing application programming
interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs) for specific services (also referred to as in-
product experiences). Details regarding such in-product experiences are described in the
respective services' reference documentation.

） Important

Services supporting in-product DSRs require direct usage of the service's
application programming interface (API) or user interface (UI), describing applicable
CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. Consequently, execution of DSRs
within a given service must be done in addition to execution of a DSR within the
Azure Portal in order to complete a full request for a given data subject. Please
refer to specific services' reference documentation for further details.

Step 1: Discover
The first step in responding to a DSR is to find the personal data that is the subject of
the request. This first step - finding and reviewing the personal data at issue - will help
you determine whether a DSR meets your organization's requirements for honoring or
declining a DSR. For example, after finding and reviewing the personal data at issue, you
may determine the request doesn't meet your organization's requirements because
doing so may adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

After you find the data, you can then perform the specific action to satisfy the request
by the data subject. For details, see the following resources:

Data collection
Data storage and processing
View personal data

Step 2: Access



After you've found Customer Data containing personal data that is potentially
responsive to a DSR, it is up to you and your organization to decide which data to
provide to the data subject. You can provide them with a copy of the actual document,
an appropriately redacted version, or a screenshot of the portions you have deemed
appropriate to share. For each of these responses to an access request, you will have to
retrieve a copy of the document or other item that contains the responsive data.

When providing a copy to the data subject, you may have to remove or redact personal
information about other data subjects and any confidential information.

The following explains how to get a copy of data in response to a DSR access request.

Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft offers both a portal and in-product experiences providing the enterprise
customer's tenant administrator the capability to manage DSR access requests. DSR
Access requests allow for access of the personal data of the user, including: (a)
identifiable information about an end user and (b) system-generated logs.

Service-Specific Interfaces
Microsoft Intune provides the ability to discover Customer Data directly via user
interfaces (UIs) or pre-existing application programming interfaces (APIs).

Step 3: Rectify
If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your
organization's data, you and your organization will have to determine whether it's
appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying the data may include taking actions such as
editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type or item.

As a data processor, Microsoft does not offer the ability to correct system-generated
logs as it reflects factual activities and constitutes a historical record of events within
Microsoft services. With respect to Intune, admins can't update device or app-specific
information. If an end user wants to correct any personal data (like the device name),
they must do so directly on their device. Such changes are synchronized the next time
they connect to Intune.

Step 4: Restrict



Data subjects may request that you restrict processing of their personal data. We
provide both the Azure portal and pre-existing application programming interfaces
(APIs) or user interfaces (UIs). These experiences provide the enterprise customer's
tenant administrator the capability to manage such DSRs through a combination of data
export and data deletion. For details, see Processing personal data.

Step 5: Delete
The "right to erasure" by the removal of personal data from an organization's Customer
Data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes removing all
personal data and system-generated logs, except audit log information. For details, see
Delete end user personal data.

Part 2: System-Generated Logs
Audit logs provide tenant admins with a record of activities that generate a change in
Microsoft Intune. Audit logs are available for many manage activities and typically
create, update (edit), delete, and assign actions. Remote tasks that generate audit events
can also be reviewed. These audit logs may contain personal data from users whose
devices are enrolled in Intune. Admins can't delete audit logs. For details, see Audit
personal data.

Notify about exporting or deleting issues
If you run into issues while exporting or deleting data from the Azure portal, go to the
Azure portal Help + Support blade and submit a new ticket under Subscription
Management > Privacy and compliance requests for Subscriptions > Privacy Blade
and GDPR Requests.

Introduction to DSRs



The GDPR gives rights to people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage
their personal data collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization
(known as the data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined broadly under
the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The
GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data. These rights include
access, correction, objection to processing, and deletion. A formal request by a data
subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is called a Data Subject
Request or DSR. Additionally, it obligates companies working on behalf of a controller
(known as the data processor or just processor) to reasonably assist the controller in
fulfilling DSRs.

This guide discusses how to find, access, and act on personal data that resides in
Microsoft IT systems that may have been collected to provide Support and other
Professional Services offerings.

In developing a response for DSRs, it's important for Microsoft's customers to
understand that Professional Services Data is separate from Customer Data in their
Online Services tenants or other data that they or their data subjects may have provided
to Microsoft. Tools and processes, such as those provided for Online Services or the
Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, can't be used to respond to DSRs for personal data held
by Microsoft Support or other Professional Services.

All requests must be made through a support representative, as described later in this
article. Currently there's no self-serve tool for customers to gain access to personal data
within the Professional Services organizations.

Overview of the processes outlined in this guide
Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that
may be the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected,
you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps
to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that the request
doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested,
make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.
Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data,
where applicable.
Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for
various Azure services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can
also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another
location.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in the Microsoft cloud.



Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable
format) of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Terminology
Here are some relevant definitions of terms from the GDPR for this guide:

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Personal data and data subject: Any information that relates to an identified or
identifiable natural person ('data subject'). An identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

Additional terms and definitions that may be helpful in
understanding this guide

Professional Services Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, image files, or
software, that's provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, Customer (or that
Customer authorizes Microsoft to obtain from a Product) or otherwise obtained or
processed by or on behalf of Microsoft through an engagement with Microsoft to
obtain Professional Services.
Customer Contact Data: Personal data that may be part of your business
relationship with Microsoft, such as personal data contained within your customer
contact information. Customer Contact Data may include your name, e-mail, or
phone number of the Premier Contract Service Manager (CSM), the Global or IT
Administrator for an Online Service, or similar roles.
Pseudonymized Data: When you use Microsoft support for Microsoft's enterprise
products and services, Microsoft generates some information linked to a Microsoft
numeric identifier to provide the support. This information is often referred to as
"Pseudonymized Data". Although this data can't be attributed to a specific data
subject without the use of additional information, some of it may be deemed
personal under GDPR's broad definition for personal data. Within Professional



Services, requests to fulfill or assist in fulfilling DSRs will always automatically
include addressing pseudonymized data.

How to use this guide
This guide covers four scenarios a customer may encounter if they have utilized
Microsoft Professional Services.

DSR for a Customer Contact Engaging Microsoft: Explanation for how Microsoft
responds to requests from a customer contact or IT administrator to exercise their
data subject rights.
DSR for an End-User Engaging Microsoft: Explanation for how Microsoft responds
to requests from a customer's employees or other data subjects to exercise their
rights.
DSR for Customer Provided Data: Commercial Support: Information about how to
receive assistance from Microsoft when a customer has received a request from
their employee or other data subjects to exercise their rights, and that data
subject's personal data was collected by Microsoft Support during a support
engagement.
DSR for Customer Provided Data: Consulting Services including FastTrack
Migration Services: Information about how to receive assistance from Microsoft
when a customer has received a request from their employee or other data
subjects to exercise their rights, and that data subject's personal data was collected
by Microsoft during a consulting engagement.

DSR for a Customer Contact Engaging
Microsoft
How Microsoft responds to requests by a customer contact or IT admin to exercise their
data subject rights.

When a customer engages with Microsoft to receive support or consulting services,
Microsoft Support automatically collects or retrieves from account records the personal
data of the Customer Contact (for example, CSM, Global Admin, IT Admin). This likely
includes the name, email, phone, and other personal data of the individual seeking
support or consulting services.

The Customer Contact's personal data is part of Microsoft's business relationship with
the customer, and Microsoft is the Data Controller, except when this data is collected in
the course of providing technical support. Microsoft responds to DSRs from the



Customer Contact regarding their personal data, regardless of whether they're still with
the organization.

When the Customer Contact's Personal Data is collected in the course of providing
technical support, Microsoft is the Data Processor.

Customers should understand that the DSR only covers the personal data of the
Customer Contact, and no changes or deletions are made to any of the customer's data
submitted as part of engagements (for example, transcripts, case descriptions, files, work
product), since Microsoft is the data processor. Additionally, to maintain the
engagement's historical record no changes at all will be made to closed engagements,
including the record of who opened an engagement.

Upon receiving an inquiry from a Customer Contact regarding a DSR where Microsoft is
the Data Controller, Microsoft personnel refer the customer contact to the Privacy
Response Center . This is Microsoft's primary input mechanism for privacy inquiries
and complaints. Upon receiving an inquiry, the Privacy Response Center identifies that
this is part of a commercial or organizational account and respond accordingly.

Where Microsoft is the Data Processor, see DSR for Customer Provided Data:
Commercial Support below.

Customers may choose to make changes to their data collected during Professional
Services engagements through normal support or consulting channels, separate from
this DSR. For instance, Microsoft can help expunge support engagements, on request
(see in the DSR Guide for Customer Provided Data section).

DSR for an End-User Engaging Microsoft
How Microsoft responds to requests from a customer's employees or other data subjects to
exercise their rights.

If a customer's employee or other data subject contacts Microsoft to exercise their rights
over data that Microsoft has collected as the data processor, the data subject will be
informed that they need to contact Microsoft's customer, as the data controller, to
exercise those rights. Microsoft takes no further action.

If the data subject has also contacted Microsoft about exercising their rights for data
Microsoft has collected in situations where Microsoft is the data controller (for example,
consumer support) then Microsoft will separately respond to the individual's data
subject right request for that personal data.



DSR for Customer Provided Data: Commercial
Support
How to receive assistance from Microsoft when a customer has received a request from
their employee or other data subjects to exercise their rights, and that data subject's
personal data was collected by Microsoft Support during a support engagement.

When a customer engages with Microsoft Support, Microsoft collects Support Data from
the customer to resolve any issues that require the support engagement. This Support
Data includes Microsoft's interaction with the customer (for example, chat, phone, email,
web submission) plus any content files the customer sends to Microsoft or Microsoft
has, with customer's permission, extracted from the customer's IT environment or Online
Services tenancy to resolve the support issue. In the case of Unified support, this would
also include any data we collect from the customer to proactively prevent future issues.
However, this excludes other information from Microsoft's business relationship with the
customer (for example, billing records).

For all Support Data and Contact Data collected in the course of providing support,
Microsoft is the data processor. As such, Microsoft's won't respond to direct requests
from data subjects regarding Support Data provided when they were associated with a
Microsoft commercial customer. Customers should contact their Customer Success
Account Manager (CSAM) for assistance.

Step 1: Discover
The first step in obtaining Microsoft's assistance in responding to a DSR is to find the
personal data that is the subject of the DSR. This first step—finding and reviewing the
personal data at issue—will help a customer determine whether a DSR meets the
organization's policies for honoring a data subject request.

After the customer finds the data, the customer can then perform the specific action to
satisfy the request by the data subject. Identifying what the customer is trying to do will
determine what level of discovery the customer needs to engage in.

Where Microsoft assists a customer with the resolution of a DSR then this is a business
function, and the request is made through your regular support channel.

In discovering relevant data and obtaining Microsoft's assistance, a customer has several
options for how to approach the DSR:

Option A: Cross-Microsoft Support Customer DSR. Apply the DSR to all the customer's
support data across Microsoft's support environment. To do this, a customer can just ask



Microsoft to apply the DSR to all Support Data collected.

Option B: Specific Customer Engagements. Use online systems to review tickets, then
identify specific engagements containing the relevant personal data and report them to
Microsoft. Microsoft attempts to provide assistance to perform a search if the customer
doesn't have the ability to search across engagements (tickets).

Once engagements are identified, request to apply the DSR to either a specific part of the
record or everything related to that engagement across Microsoft.

To identify specific engagements, customers need to search across their engagements.
For Unified customers, the Customer Success Account Manager ("CSAM") for a customer
has visibility across all Support Requests (SRs) that are created under the customer's
Contract Schedule. For Non-Unified customers, equivalent support engagement portals
are available, such as through Online Services support areas.

The CSAM can go to the portal at Services Hub  and select manage all Support
Requests.

） Important

In addition to the case history in Services Hub, customers may also have personal
data of an end user in files that were collected by Microsoft (or, with customer's
permission, removed from the Online Service) during a support engagement.
Examples may include copies of the customer's exchange mailboxes, Azure VMs, or
databases. This personal data may or may not be mentioned in the case history (i.e.
ticket) for a particular engagement. To review that data, the Customer Contact must
be a specific authenticated (via AAD or MSA) Support Request contact that has
received a URL for a workspace in Microsoft Support Data Transfer and
Management tool (DTM). A Customer Contact will have access to the files, but no
global view is available, and Services Hub will not indicate if files exist.

Once customers have identified all the relevant data in the selected support tickets,
customers can decide whether to request the deletion of everything related to a ticket
or selectively apply the DSR to individual instances of personal data.

Step 2: Access
After a customer has found Support Data containing personal data that is potentially
responsive to a DSR, it is up to the customer to decide which personal data to include in



the response. For example, the customer may choose to remove personal data about
other data subjects and any confidential information.

Response to the DSR may include a copy of the actual document, an appropriately
redacted version, or a screenshot of the portions the customer has deemed appropriate
to share. For each of these responses to an access request, the customer has to retrieve
a copy of the document or other item that contains the responsive data.

Access to the personal data of an end user may be from a mention or notation in the
various types of content documentation. Since customers may access the engagement
ticket and the content, they can provide a summary of personal data themselves without
further assistance from Microsoft.

In rare cases, customers may have need to obtain copies of support interaction data (for
example, emails, transcribed copies of phone recordings; chat transcripts) between a
Microsoft Representative and the Customer's Representative. To the extent required,
Microsoft may provide redacted copies of these transcripts based on need, sensitivity,
and difficulty.

Step 3: Rectify
If a data subject has asked the customer to rectify the personal data that resides in their
organization's Support Data, the customer has to determine whether it's appropriate to
honor the request. If the customer chooses to honor the request, then the customer
may request that Microsoft make the change. Microsoft may rectify data or may delete
customer's data from the support systems and request that the customer resubmit it to
Microsoft in corrected format.

Step 4: Restrict
The customer may at any time close an engagement or contact Microsoft and request
the engagement be closed. A closed engagement prevents any work from being
performed.

Step 5: Delete
The "right to erasure" by the removal of personal data from an organization's Support
Data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes deleting entire
engagements, documents, or files or deleting specific data within an engagement,
document, or file.



As a customer investigates or prepares to delete personal data in response to a DSR,
here are a few important things to understand about how deletion works for Microsoft
Support.

All data at Microsoft has a retention and deletion policy applied to it, which will vary
depending on risk and other factors.

Customers requesting the deletion of a data subject's personal data universally across
Support systems may do so through your Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM)
or by filing a Support Request (SR) in Services Hub or equivalent system. You must
indicate that this is a request to assist with a DSR under GDPR.

Option A: Cross-Microsoft Support Customer DSR. For a cross system DSR, the customer
must provide the personal data that Microsoft needs to identify the required data (for
example, email address; phone number). Microsoft won't correlate or research records
and will only search directly on identifiers provided by the customer. When data is
found, Microsoft deletes all engagements and all associated data.

Important Note: this may result in the loss of historical records that are important to
the customer's organization.

Option B: Specific Customer Engagements. For specific engagements that the customer
has identified and wants deleted, don't delete tickets out of Services Hub. This results in
personal data remaining in logs and downstream systems that may not be deleted
within the needed timeframe. Instead, identify the ticket or personal data within the
ticket that must be deleted, and contact Microsoft Support to assist you in deleting that
data.

Microsoft Support Data Transfer and Management tool
(DTM) instructions
For all these searches, Microsoft won't search across DTM due to the potential sensitivity
of content in files. However, if the customer desires, Microsoft deletes all files contained
in DTM associated with the customer's account. Due to the potential for serious
customer impact, Microsoft requires a separate request from customer specifying the
deletion of DTM files.

For open cases or for cases closed less than 90 days prior, the Customer Contact
can go into DTM and delete files.
By default, files are automatically deleted 90 days after the case is closed.
Customers should also request Microsoft to check across systems for the personal
data as files are occasionally copied from DTM to other systems for diagnostic



purposes via their CSAM or through the Privacy Response Center .

Step 6: Export
The "right of data portability" allows a data subject to request a copy of their personal
data in an electronic format and request that your organization transmit it to another
controller. In the case of Support Data, any usable information that Microsoft has would
be in the form of engagement information or files that can be returned to you for re-
communication or uploading to another controller.

Note: Exported data may not include Microsoft's intellectual property or any data that
may compromise the security or stability of the service.

DSR Guide for Customer Provided Data in
Consulting Services including Migration
Services
How to receive assistance from Microsoft when a customer has received a request from
their employee or other data subjects to exercise their rights, and that data subject's
personal data was collected by Microsoft during a consulting engagement.

Industry Solutions Delivery
For Industry Solutions Delivery (ISD) engagements contracted under the Microsoft
Products and Services Data Protection Addendum  (DPA):

Microsoft is the data controller for Customer Contacts working with the engagement
team. Those individuals should contact the Privacy Response Center  to fulfill data
subject rights.

Microsoft is the data processor for a DSR located within data provided during a
consulting engagement. The customer should contact their Customer Success Account
Manager (CSAM) to build in a plan to assist in responding to a DSR based on the data
collected and the specific type of consulting services provided. To the extent your
request constitutes a level of effort typically seen within Industry Solutions Delivery,
there may be an additional work order required. Additionally, personal data will be
deleted after each consulting engagement within a timeframe dependent on the type of
consulting engagement. Customer can request data to be deleted sooner and request
an attestation of deletion.



Microsoft FastTrack Services
Microsoft FastTrack  provides IT consulting services to organizations to help them
onboard and use Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics
365.

Microsoft is the data controller for Corporate Customer Contacts working with the
FastTrack to deploy and migrate to the above-mentioned Microsoft cloud services. If
you're a Corporate organization, working with Microsoft FastTrack on your deployment
and you wish to access, revise, or remove contact information from Microsoft's FastTrack
records, you may submit a Data Subject Request (DSR) by sending a request to the
FastTrack for Microsoft 365 - Corporate GDPR requests inbox
(O365ftgdpr@microsoft.com).

For FastTrack migration services, Microsoft is the data processor. In accordance with our
Fast Track additional privacy disclosure statement, all data in migration is considered
"migration data." If you need to execute DSRs while your organization is engaged in a
FastTrack migration project, special care is required.

If you need to process any access, rectify, or export DSR requests while a user's data is
being processed through FastTrack migration systems, it is the customer's responsibility
to fulfill such DSRs through your existing source systems in which the user data is
stored. Once the user's migration is complete and the data has been migrated to the
destination Microsoft cloud service, the guidance provided by Microsoft on how
customers can use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to find and act
on personal data to respond to data subject request will then apply. To view this
guidance, see Data Subject Requests for the GDPR.

If you need to delete a user account in response to a DSR delete request while your
organization is engaged in an ongoing FastTrack migration project, you should be aware
that migration systems may retain a copy of user migration data for a period of time
following completion of the user's migration and deleting the user account won't
automatically delete such user migration data stored in FastTrack migration systems. If
you would like the Microsoft FastTrack team to delete user migration data, you can
submit a request . In the ordinary course of business, Microsoft FastTrack deletes all
data copies once your organization's migration is complete.

Other Consulting Services
Customers receiving other Consulting Services through Microsoft should work through
the engagement team for fulfillment of all GDPR requirements. If the engagement team



isn't able to provide clear instructions on GDPR DSR fulfillment, customers should
contact their CSAM or submit a request for technical support.

Office 365 Data Subject Requests for the
GDPR and CCPA
Article • 03/07/2025

Introduction to DSRs
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has
been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the
data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as
any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data
subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of it,
requesting changes to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an
electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal request by a data
subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is called a Data Subject
Request or DSR. The controller is obligated to promptly consider each DSR and provide
a substantive response either by taking the requested action or by providing an
explanation for why the DSR can't be accommodated by the controller. A controller
should consult with its own legal or compliance advisors regarding the proper
disposition of any given DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

This guide discusses how to use the Office 365 features and administrative tools that are
generally available to all Office 365 customers, to help you find and act on personal data
or personal information to respond to DSRs. Specifically, this includes how to find,
access, and act on personal data or personal information that resides in Microsoft's
cloud.

Your organization may subscribe to Microsoft Priva , which offers additional
complementary functionality related to investigating and servicing a DSR. You aren't
required to subscribe to Microsoft Priva to use the features described in the following



sections to research and respond to DSRs. For more information about getting started
with Microsoft Priva, see Learn about Microsoft Priva.

Here's a quick overview of the processes outlined in this guide:

Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that
may be the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected,
you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps
to respond to the request. Alternatively, you may determine that the request
doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested,
make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.
Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data,
where applicable.
Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for
various Microsoft cloud services or turning off the desired services where possible.
You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at
another location.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in the Microsoft cloud.
Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable
format) of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Terminology
Here are definitions of terms from the GDPR that are relevant to this guide.

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and
software that is provided to Microsoft by or on behalf of, a customer through use
of the enterprise service. Customer Data includes both (1) identifiable information



of end users (for example, user names and contact information in Microsoft Entra
ID) and Customer Content that a customer uploads into or creates in specific
services (for example, customer content in a Word or Excel document, or in the text
of an Exchange Online email; customer content added to a SharePoint site, or
saved to a OneDrive for work or school account).
System-Generated Logs: Logs and related data generated by Microsoft that help
Microsoft provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain
primarily pseudonymized data, such as unique identifiers (typically a number
generated by the system) can't on its own identify an individual person but is used
to deliver the enterprise services to users.

How to use this guide
To help you find information relevant to your use case, this guide is divided into four
parts.

Part 1: Responding to DSRs for Customer Data: Customer Data is data produced
and stored in Office 365 in the day-to-day operations of running your business.
Examples of the most commonly used Office 365 applications that allow you to
author data include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Office 365
also consists of applications such as SharePoint, Teams, and Forms that allow you
to better collaborate with others. Part 1 of this guide discusses how to discover
access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export data from Office 365 applications that
have been used to author and store data in Office 365 online services. It addresses
products and services for which Microsoft is acting as a data processor to your
organization, and thus DSR capability is made available to your tenant
administrator.

Part 2: Responding to DSRs with Respect to Insights Generated by Office 365:
Office 365 provides certain insights through services like Viva Personal Insights,
and Viva Manager. How these insights are generated and how to respond to DSRs
related to them are explained in Part 2 of this guide.

Part 3: Responding to DSRs for system-generated Logs: When you use Office 365
enterprise services, Microsoft generates some information such as service logs that
record the use or performance of features in the online services. Most service-
generated data contain pseudonymous identifiers generated by Microsoft and this
category is thus generally referred to within this document as system-generated
logs. Although this data can't be attributed to a specific data subject without the
use of additional information, some of it may be deemed personal under GDPR's
definition for "personal data." Part 3 of this guide discusses how to access, delete,
and export system-generated logs.



Part 4: Additional resources to assist you with DSRs: Part 4 of this guide lists
limited scenarios in which Microsoft is the data controller when certain Office 365
products and services are used.

７ Note

In most cases, when users in your organization use Microsoft Office 365 products
and services, you are the data controller and Microsoft is the processor. As a data
controller, you are responsible for responding to the data subject directly. To assist
you with this, Parts 1-3 of this guide detail the technical capabilities available to
your organization to respond to a DSR request. In some limited scenarios, however,
Microsoft will be the data controller when people use certain Office 365 products
and services. In these cases, the information in Part 4 provides guidance on how
data subjects can submit DSR requests to Microsoft.

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and personal data
Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 connects Large language models (LLMs) to your
organizational data. When a tenant uses Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, the
prompt information and the generated responses are stored in the user's mailbox.

Addressing a DSR for Copilot-related personal data means to discover, view, export, and
delete all personal data in Copilot for Microsoft 365. Administrators can use eDiscovery
tools in the Microsoft Purview portal or the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

For more information and step by step guidance, see:

Microsoft Purview supports compliance management for Copilot
Search for and delete Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 data in eDiscovery
(preview)
Search for and delete Copilot for Microsoft 365 data in eDiscovery
Learn about retention for CoPilot for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 national clouds
The Microsoft Office 365 services are also available in the following national cloud
environments: Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), and Office 365 US
Government . Most of the guidance for managing data subject requests described in
this document applies to these national cloud environments. However, due to the
isolated nature of these environments, there are some exceptions. Where notable for a
given subsection, these exceptions are called out in a corresponding note.



Hybrid deployments
Your organization may consist of Microsoft offerings that are a combination of cloud-
based services and on-premises server products. In general, a hybrid deployment is
typically the sharing of user accounts (identity management) and resources (such as
mailboxes, web sites, and data) that exist in the cloud and on-premises. Common hybrid
scenarios include:

Exchange hybrid deployments, where some users have an on-premises mailbox
and other users have Exchange Online mailboxes.
SharePoint hybrid deployments, where site and file servers are on-premises and
OneDrive for work or school accounts are in Office 365.
The on-premises identity management system (Active Directory) that is
synchronized with Azure Activity Directory, which is the underlying directory
service in Office 365.

When responding to a DSR request, you may have to determine if data that's responsive
to a DSR request is in the Microsoft cloud or in your on-premises organization, and then
take the appropriate steps to respond to that request. The Office 365 Data Subject
Request Guide (this guide) provides guidance for responding to cloud-based data. For
guidance for data in your on-premises organization, see GDPR for Office on-premises
Servers.

Part 1: Responding to DSRs for Customer Data
The guidance for responding to DSRs for Customer Data is divided into the following
four sections:

Using the Content Search eDiscovery tool to respond to DSRs
Using In-App functionality to respond to DSRs
Responding to DSR rectification requests
Responding to DSR restriction requests

How to determine the Microsoft 365 applications that
may be in scope for a DSR for Customer Data
To help you determine where to search for personal data or what to search for, it helps
to identify the Microsoft 365 applications that people in your organization can use to
create and store data in Microsoft 365. Knowing this narrows the Microsoft 365
applications that are in-scope for a DSR and helps you determine how to search for and
access personal data that's related to a DSR. Specifically, this means whether you can



use the Content Search tool or if you'll have to use the in-app functionality of the
application the data was created in.

A quick way to identify the Microsoft 365 applications that people in your organization
are using to create Customer Data is to determine which applications are included in
your organization's Microsoft 365 for business subscription. To do this, you can access
user accounts in the Microsoft 365 admin portal and look at the product licensing
information. See Assign licenses to users.

Using the Content Search eDiscovery tool to
respond to DSRs
When looking for personal data within the larger set of data your organization creates
and stores using in Microsoft 365, you may want to first consider which applications
people have most likely used to author the data you're looking for. Microsoft estimates
that over 90% of an organization's data that is stored in Microsoft 365 is authored in
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook. Documents authored in these Office
applications, even if purchased through Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise or an Office
perpetual license, are most likely stored on a SharePoint site, in a user's OneDrive for
work and school account, or in a user's Exchange Online mailbox. That means you can
use the Content Search eDiscovery tool to search (and perform other DSR-related
actions) across SharePoint sites, OneDrive for work and school accounts, and Exchange
Online mailboxes (including the sites and mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365
Groups, Microsoft Teams, Assignments and Class Notebook) to find documents and
mailbox items that may be relevant to the DSR you're investigating. You can also use the
Content Search tool to discover Customer Data authored in other Office 365
applications.

The following list identifies the Microsoft 365 applications that people use to create
Customer Authored Content and that can be discovered by using Content Search. This
section of the DSR guide provides guidance about how to discover, access, export, and
delete data created with these Office 365 applications.

Applications where Content Search can be used to find Customer Data:

The Content Search eDiscovery tool is not available in Office 365 operated by
21Vianet (China). This means you won't able to use this tool to search for and
export Customer Data in the Office 365 applications shown in Table 1. However,
you can use the In-Place eDiscovery tool in Exchange Online to search for content
in user mailboxes. You can also use the eDiscovery Center in SharePoint to search
for content in SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts. Alternatively, you can ask a
document owner to help you find and make changes or deletions to content or
export it if necessary. For more information, see:

Create an In-Place eDiscovery search
Set up an eDiscovery Center in SharePoint

Using Content Search to find personal data
The first step in responding to a DSR is to find the personal data that is the subject of
the DSR. This consists of using Office 365 eDiscovery tools to search for personal data
(among all your organization's data in Office 365) or going directly to the native
application in which the data was created. This first step, finding and reviewing the
personal data at issue, will help you determine whether a DSR meets your organization's
requirements for honoring or declining a data subject request. For example, after finding
and reviewing the personal data at issue, you may determine the request doesn't meet
your organization's requirements because doing so may adversely affect the rights and
freedoms of others, or because the personal data is contained in a business record your
organization has a legitimate business interest in retaining.



As previously stated, Microsoft estimates that over 90% of an organization's data is
created with Office applications, such as Word and Excel. This means that you can use
the Content Search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to search for most DSR-
related data.

This guide assumes that you or the person searching for personal data that may be
responsive to a DSR request is familiar with or has experience using the Content Search
tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. For general guidance on using Content
Search, see Content Search in Office 365. Be sure that the person running the searches
has been assigned the necessary permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance
portal. This person should be added as a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group
in compliance portal; see Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Microsoft Purview
compliance portal. Consider adding other people in your organization who are involved
in investigating DSRs to the eDiscovery Manager role group, so they can perform the
necessary actions in the Content Search tool such as previewing and exporting search
results. However, unless you set up compliance boundaries (as described here) an
eDiscovery Manager can search all content locations in your organization, including
ones that may not be related to a DSR investigation.

After you find the data, you can then perform the specific action to satisfy the request
by the data subject.

Searching content locations
You can search the following types of content locations with the Content Search tool.

Exchange Online mailboxes. This includes the mailboxes associated with Microsoft
365 Groups and Microsoft Teams
Exchange Online public folders
SharePoint sites. This includes the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups and
Microsoft Teams
OneDrive for work and school accounts

７ Note

This guide assumes that all data that might be relevant to a DSR investigation is
stored in Office 365; in other words, stored in the Microsoft cloud. Data stored on a
user's local computer or on-premises on your organization's file servers is outside
the scope of a DSR investigation for data stored in Office 365. For guidance about
responding to DSR requests for data in on-premises organizations, see GDPR for
Office on-premises Servers.



Tips for searching content locations
Begin by searching all content locations in your organization (which you can search
in a single search) to quickly determine which content locations contain items that
match your search query. Then you can rerun the search and narrow the search
scope to the specific locations that contain relevant items.
Use search statistics to identify the top locations that contain items that match
your search query. See View keyword statistics for Content Search results.
Search the audit log for recent file and folder activities performed by the user who
is the subject of the DSR. Searching the audit log returns a list of auditing records
that contain the name and location of resources the user has recently interacted
with. You may be able to use this information to build a content search query. See
Search the audit log in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

Building search queries to find personal data
The DSR you're investigating most likely contains identifiers that you can use in the
keyword search query to search for the personal data. Here are some common
identifiers that can be used in a search query to find personal data:

Email address or alias
Phone number
Mailing address
Employee ID number
National ID number or EU member version of a Social Security Number

The DSR that you're investigating most likely will have an identifier and other details
about the personal data that is the subject of the request that you can use in a search
query.

Searching for just an email address or employee ID will probably return many results. To
narrow the scope of your search so it returns content most relevant to the DSR, you can
add conditions to the search query. When you add a condition, the keyword and a
search condition are logically connected by the AND Boolean operator. This means only
items that match both the keyword and the condition will be returned in the search
results.

The following table lists some conditions you can use to narrow the scope of a search.
The table also lists the values that you can use for each condition to search for specific
document types and mailbox items.

In addition to searching for personal data in documents, you can also use Content
Search to search for other types of data that's created by using native SharePoint apps.
This includes data created by using SharePoint lists, discussions, and forms. When you
run a Content Search and search SharePoint sites (or OneDrive for work and school
accounts) data from lists, discussions, and forms that match the search criteria will be
returned in the search results.

Working with partially indexed items in Content Search
Partially indexed items (also called unindexed items) are Exchange Online mailbox items
and documents on SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school sites that for some
reason weren't indexed for search, which means they aren't searchable by using Content
Search. Most email messages and site documents are successfully indexed because they
fall within the indexing limits for Office 365. The reasons that email messages or files
aren't indexed for search include:

The file type is unrecognized or unsupported for indexing. Though sometimes the
file type is supported for indexing but an indexing error occurred for a specific file
Email messages have an attached file without a valid handler, such as image file
(this is the most common cause of partially indexed email items)
Files attached to email messages are too large or there are too many attached files

We recommend that you learn more about partially indexed items so that you can work
with them when responding to DSR requests. For more information, see:

Partially indexed items in Content Search in Office 365
Investigating partially indexed items in Office 365 eDiscovery
Exporting unindexed items

Tips for working with partially indexed items
It's possible that data responsive to a DSR investigation may be in a partially indexed
item. Here's some suggestions for working with partially indexed items:



After you run a search, the number of estimated partially items is displayed in the
search statistics. This estimate doesn't include partially indexed items in SharePoint
and OneDrive for work and school. Export the reports for a Content Search to get
information about partially indexed items. The Unindexed Items.csv report
contains information about unindexed items, including the location of the item,
the URL if the item is in SharePoint or OneDrive for work and school, and the
subject line (for messages) or name of the document. For more information, see
Export a Content Search report.

The statistics and list of partially indexed items that are returned with the results of
a Content Search are all the partially items from the content locations that are
searched.

To retrieve partially indexed items that are potentially responsive to a DSR
investigation, you can do one of the following things:

Export all partially indexed items

You export both the results of a content search and the partially indexed items from the
content location that were search. You can also export only the partially indexed items.
Then you can open them in their native application and review the content. You have to
use this option to export items from SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school. See
Export Content Search results from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

Export a specific set of partially indexed items from mailboxes

Instead of exporting all partially indexed mailbox items from a search, you can rerun a
Content Search to search for a specific list of partially indexed items, and then export
them. You can do this only for mailbox items. See Prepare a CSV file for a targeted
Content Search in Office 365.

Next steps
After you find the personal data that's relevant to the DSR, be sure to retain the specific
Content Search that you used to find the data. You'll likely reuse this search to complete
other steps in the DSR response process, such as obtaining a copy of it, exporting it, or
permanently deleting it.

Additional considerations for selected applications



The following sections describe things you should keep in mind when searching for data
in the following Microsoft 365 applications.

Microsoft Lens
OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint Experience Settings
Assignments and OneNote Class Notebook
Microsoft To Do
Skype for Business

Microsoft Lens
A person using Microsoft Lens (a camera app supported by devices running iOS,
Android, and Windows) can take a picture of whiteboards, hardcopy documents,
business cards, and other things that contain a lot of text. Microsoft Lens uses optical
character recognition technology that extracts text in an image and save it to a
Microsoft document such as a Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote or to a PDF file. Users
can then upload the file that contains the text from the image to their OneDrive for
work and school account in Microsoft 365. That means you can use the Content Search
tool to search, access, delete, and export data in files that were created from a Microsoft
Lens image. For more information about Microsoft Lens, see:

Microsoft Lens for iOS
Microsoft Lens for Android
Microsoft Lens for Windows

OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint experience settings
In addition to user-created files stored in OneDrive for work and school accounts and
SharePoint sites, these services store information about the user that is used to enable
various experiences. Users still in your organization can access much of this information
by using in-product functionality. The following information provides guidance on how
to access, view, and export OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint application
data.

SharePoint user profiles

The user's Microsoft 365 profile allows users to maintain properties stored in the
SharePoint user profile, including birthday, mobile phone number (and other contact
information), about me, projects, skills and expertise, schools and education, interests,
and hobbies.



End users

End users can discover, access, and rectify SharePoint user profile data using the
Microsoft 365 profile experience on Microsoft365.com. See Edit your profile in Microsoft
365  for more details.

Another way for users to access their SharePoint profile data is to navigate to the edit
profile page in their OneDrive for work and school account, which can be accessed by
going to the EditProfile.aspx path under the OneDrive for work and school account URL.
For example, for a user user1@contoso.com, the user's OneDrive for work and school
account is at:

HTTP

https://contoso-
my.sharepoint.com/personal/user1\_contoso\_com/\_layouts/15/OneDrive.aspx

The URL for the edit profile page would be:

HTTP

https://contoso-
my.sharepoint.com/personal/user1\_contoso\_com/\_layouts/15/EditProfile.aspx

Properties sourced in Microsoft Entra ID can't be changed within SharePoint. However,
users can go to their Account page by selecting their photo in the Office 365 header,
and then selecting My account. Changing the properties here may require users to work
with their admins to discover, access, or rectify a user profile property.

Admins

An admin can access and rectify profile properties in the SharePoint admin center. In the
SharePoint admin center, select the user profiles tab. select Manage user profiles, enter
a user's name, and then select Find. The admin can right select any user and select Edit
My Profile. Properties sourced in Microsoft Entra ID can't be changed within SharePoint.

An admin can export all User Profile properties for a user by using the Export-
SPOUserProfile cmdlet in SharePoint PowerShell. See Export-SPOUserProfile.

For more information about user profiles, see Manage user profiles in the SharePoint
admin center.

User Information list on SharePoint sites



A subset of a user's SharePoint user profile is synchronized to the User information list
of every site that they visit or have permissions to access. This is used by SharePoint
experiences, such as People columns in document libraries, to display basic information
about the user, such as the name of the creator of a document. The data in a User
Information list matches the information stored in SharePoint user profile and will be
automatically rectified if the source is changed. For deleted users, this data remains in
the sites they interacted with for referential integrity of SharePoint column fields.

Admins can control which properties are replicable inside the SharePoint admin center.
To do this:

1. Go to the SharePoint admin center and select the user profiles tab.
2. select Manage User Properties to see a list of properties.
3. Right-select any property and select Edit and adjust various settings.
4. Under Policy Settings, the replicable property controls whether the property will

be represented in the User information list. Not all properties support adjusting
this.

An admin can export all User information properties for a user on a given site by using
the Export-SPOUserInfo cmdlet in SharePoint PowerShell. See Export-SPOUserInfo.

OneDrive for work and school experience settings

A user's OneDrive for work and school experience stores information to help the user
find and navigate content of interest to them. Most of this information can be accessed
by end users using in-product features. An admin can export the information using a
PowerShell Script and SharePoint Client-Side Object Model (CSOM) commands.

See Export OneDrive for work and school experience settings for more information
about the settings, how they're stored, and how to export them.

OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint search

The in-app search experience in OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint stores a
user's search queries for 30 days to increase relevance of search results. An admin can
export search queries for a user by using the Export-SPOQueryLogs cmdlet in
SharePoint PowerShell. See Export-SPOQueryLogs.

Assignments and OneNote Class Notebook
Microsoft Teams for Education offers two additional collaboration features that teachers
and students can use that creates and stores personal data: Assignments and OneNote



Class Notebook. You can use Content Search to discover data in both.

Assignments

Students' files associated with an Assignment are stored in a document library in the
corresponding Teams SharePoint site. IT admins can use the Content Search tool to
search for student files that are related to assignments. For example, an admin could
search all SharePoint sites in the organization and use the student's name and class or
assignment name in the search query to find data relevant to a DSR.

There's other data related to Assignments that isn't stored in the class team SharePoint
site, which means it's not discoverable with Content Search. This includes:

Files that the teacher assigns to students as part of the assignment
Student grades and feedback from the teacher
The list of documents submitted for an assignment by each student
Assignment metadata

For this type of data, an IT admin or data owner (such as a teacher) may have to go into
the Assignment in the class team to find data relevant to a DSR.

OneNote Class Notebook

The OneNote Class Notebook is stored in the class team SharePoint site. Every student
in a class has a private notebook that's shared with the teacher. There's also a content
library where a teacher can share documents with students, and a collaboration space
for all students in the class. Data related to these capabilities is discoverable with
Content Search.

Here's specific guidance to search for a Class Notebook.

1. Run a Content Search using the following search criteria:

Search all SharePoint sites
Include the name of the class team as a search keyword; for example, "9C
Biology."

2. Preview the search results and look for the item that corresponds to the Class
Notebook.

3. Select that item, and then copy the folder path that's displayed in the details pane.
This is the root folder for the Class Notebook.



4. Edit the search that you created in step 1 and replace the class name in the
keyword query with the folder path of the Class Notebook and precede the folder
path with the path site property; for example, path:
<https://contosoedu.onmicrosoft.com/sites/9C>  Biology/SiteAssets/9C Biology
Notebook/. Be sure to include the quotation marks and the trailing forward slash.

5. Add a search condition and select the File Type condition and use one for the
value of the file type. This returns all OneNote files in the search results. The
resulting keyword syntax would look something like this:

Query

path:"<https://contosoedu.onmicrosoft.com/sites/9C> 
Biology/SiteAssets/9C Biology Notebook/" AND filetype="one"

6. Rerun the Content Search. The search results should include all OneNote files for
the Class Notebook from the class team.

Microsoft To Do
Tasks (called to-dos, which are saved in to-do lists) in Microsoft To Do are saved as tasks
in a user's Exchange Online mailbox. That means that you can use the Content Search
tool to search, access, delete, and export to-dos. For more information, see Set up
Microsoft To Do .

Skype for Business
Here some additional information about how to access, view, and export personal data
in Skype for Business.

Files attached to a meeting are retained in the actual meeting for 180 days and
then become inaccessible. These files can be accessed by meeting participants by
joining the meeting from the meeting request and then viewing or downloading
the attached file. See the "Use the attachments in the meeting" section in Preload
attachments for a Skype for Business meeting .
Conversations in Skype for Business are retained in the Conversation History folder
in user mailboxes. You can use Content Search to search mailboxes for data in
Skype conversations.
A data subject can export their contacts in Skype for Business. To do this, they
would right-select a contact group in Skype for Business and select Copy. Then
they can paste the list of email addresses into a text or Word document.



If the Exchange Online mailbox of a meeting participant is placed on Litigation
Hold or assigned to an Office 365 retention policy, files attached to a meeting are
retained in the participants mailbox. You can use Content Search to search for
those files in the participant's mailbox if the retention period for the file hasn't
expired. For more information about retaining files, see Retaining large files
attached to a Skype for Business meeting.

Providing a copy of personal data
After you've found personal data that is potentially responsive to a DSR, it's up to you
and your organization to decide which data to provide the data subject. For example,
you can provide them with a copy of the actual document, an appropriately redacted
version, or a screenshot of the portions that you've deemed appropriate to share. For
each of these responses to an access request, you'll have to retrieve a copy of the
document or other item that contains the responsive data.

When providing a copy to the data subject, you may have to remove or redact personal
information about other data subjects and any confidential information.

Using Content Search to get a copy of personal data
There are two ways to use the Content Search tool to get a copy of a document or
mailbox item that you've found after running a search.

Preview the search results and then download a copy of the document or item.
This is a good way to download a few items or files.
Export the search results and then download a copy of all items returned by the
search. This method is more complex, but it's a good way to download lots of
items that are responsive to the DSR. Useful reports are also included with you
export search results. You can use these reports to get additional information
about each item. The Results.csv report is useful because it contains a lot of
information about the exported items, such as the exact location of the item (for
example, the mailbox for email messages or the URL for documents or lists on
SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school sites). This information helps you
identify the owner of the item, in case you need to contact them during the DSR
investigation process. For more information about the reports that are included
when you export search results, see Export a Content Search report.

Preview and download items



After you run a new search or open an existing search, you can preview each item that
matched the search query to verify that it's related to the DSR you're investigating. This
also includes SharePoint lists and web pages that are returned in the search results. You
can also download the original file if you have to provide it to the data subject. In both
cases, you could take a screenshot to satisfy the data subject's request obtain the
information.

Some types of items can't be previewed. If an item or file type isn't supported for
preview, you have the option to download an individual item to your local computer or
to a mapped network drive or other network location. You can only preview supported
file types.

To preview and download items:

1. Open the Content Search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
2. If the results aren't displayed, select Preview results.
3. select an item to view it.
4. select Download original file to download the item to your local computer. You'll

also have to download items that can't be previewed.

For more information about previewing search results, see Preview search results.

Export and download items
You can also export the results of a content search to get a copy of email messages,
documents, lists, and web pages containing the personal data, though this method is
more involved than previewing items. See the next section for details about exporting
the results of a Content Search.

Exporting personal data
The "right of data portability" allows a data subject to request an electronic copy of
personal data that's in a "structured, commonly used, machine-readable format", and to
request that your organization transmit these electronic files to another data controller.
Microsoft supports this right in two ways:

Offering Office 365 applications that save data in native, machine-readable,
commonly used electronic format. For more information about Office file formats,
see Office File Formats-Technical Documents .
Enabling your organization to export the data in the native file format, or a format
(such as CSV, TXT, and JSON) that can be easily imported to another application.



To meet a DSR export request, you can export Office documents in their native file
format and export data from other Office 365 applications.

Export and download content using Content Search
When you export the results of a Content Search, email items can be downloaded as
PST files or as individual messages (.msg files). When you export documents and lists
from SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school sites, copies in the native file formats
are exported. For example, SharePoint lists are exported as CSV files and Web pages are
exported as .aspx or html files.

７ Note

Exporting mailbox items from a user's mailbox using Content Search requires that
the user (whose mailbox you're exporting items from) is assigned an Exchange
Online Plan 2 license.

To export and download items:

1. Open the Content Search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
2. On the search fly out page, select  More, and then select Export results. You can

also export a report.
3. Complete the sections on the Export results fly out page. Be sure to use the scroll

bar to view all export options.
4. Go back to the Content search page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal,

and select the Export tab.
5. select Refresh to update the page.
6. Under the Name column, select the export job that you created. The name of the

export job is the name of the content search appended with _Export.
7. On the export fly out page, under Export key, select Copy to clipboard. You'll use

this key in step 10 to download the search results
8. On the top of the fly out page, select  Download results.
9. If you're prompted to install the Microsoft Office 365 eDiscovery Export Tool,

select Install.
10. In the eDiscovery Export Tool, paste the export key that you copied in step 7 in

the appropriate box.
11. select Browse to specify the location where you want to download the search

result files.
12. select Start to download the search results to your computer.



When the export process is complete, you can access the files in the location on your
local computer where they were downloaded. Results of a content search are
downloaded to a folder named after the Content Search. Documents from sites are
copied to a subfolder named SharePoint. Mailbox items are copied to subfolder named
Exchange.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see Export Content Search results from the
Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

Downloading documents and lists from SharePoint and
OneDrive for work and school
Another way to export data from SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school is to
download documents and lists directly from a SharePoint site or a OneDrive for work
and school account. You would have to get assigned the permissions to access a site,
and then go to the site and download the contents. See:

Download files and folders from OneDrive or SharePoint
Export SharePoint lists to Excel

For some DSR export requests, you may want to allow the data subject to download
content themselves. This enables the data subject to go to a SharePoint site or shared
folder and select Sync to sync all contents in the document library or selected folders.
See:

Enable users to sync SharePoint files with the new OneDrive sync client
Sync SharePoint files with the new OneDrive sync client

Deleting personal data
The "right to erasure" by the removal of personal data from an organization's Customer
Data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes deleting entire
documents or files or deleting specific data within a document or file (which would be
an action and process like the ones described in the Rectify section in this guide).

As you investigate or prepare to delete personal data in response to a DSR, here are a
few important things to understand about how data deletion (and retention) works in
Office 365.

Soft delete vs. hard delete: In Office 365 services such as Exchange Online,
SharePoint, and OneDrive for work and school there's the concept of soft deletion
and hard deletion, which relates to the recoverability of a deleted item (usually for



a limited period) before it's permanently removed from the Microsoft cloud with
no chance of recovery. In this context, a soft-deleted item can be recovered by a
user and/or an admin for a limited amount of time before it's hard-deleted. When
an item has been hard-deleted, it's marked for permanent removal and is purged
when it's processed by the corresponding Office 365 service. Here's how soft
delete and hard delete works for items in mailboxes and sites (regardless of
whether the data owner or an admin deletes an item):

Mailboxes: An item is soft-deleted when it's deleted from the Deleted Items
folder or when a user deletes an item by pressing Shift + Delete. When item is
soft-deleted, it's moved to the Recoverable Items folder in the mailbox. At this
point, the item can be recovered by the user until the deleted item retention
period expires (in Office 365, the deleted item retention period is 14 days, but
can be increased up to 30 days by an admin). After the retention period expires,
the item is hard-deleted and moved to a hidden folder (called the Purges
folder). The item will be permanently removed (purged) from Office 365 the
next time the mailbox is processed (mailboxes are processed once every seven
days).

SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school sites: When a file or
documented is deleted, it's moved to the site's Recycle Bin (also called the first-
stage Recycle Bin (which is like the Recycle Bin in Windows). The item remains in
the Recycle Bin for 93 days (the deleted item retention period for sites in Office
365). After that period, the item is automatically moved to Recycle Bin for the
site collection, which also called the second-stage Recycle Bin. (Note that users
or admins--with the appropriate permissions--can also delete items from the
first-stage Recycle Bin). At this point, the item becomes soft-deleted; it can still
be recovered by a site collection administrator in SharePoint or by the user or
admin in OneDrive for work and school). When an item is deleted from the
second-stage Recycle Bin (either manually or automatically), it becomes hard-
deleted and isn't accessible by user or an admin. The retention period is 93 days
for both the first-stage and second-stage recycle bins. That means the second-
stage Recycle Bin retention starts when the item is first deleted. Therefore, the
total maximum retention time is 93 days for both recycle bins.

７ Note

Understanding the actions that result in an item being soft-deleted or hard-deleted
will help you determine how to delete data in a way that meets GDPR requirements
when responding to a deletion request.



Legal holds and retention policies: In Office 365, a "hold" can be place on
mailboxes and sites. In short, this means that nothing is permanently removed
(hard-deleted) if a mailbox or site is on hold, until the retention period for an item
expires or until the hold is removed. This is important in the context of deleting
Customer Content in response to a DSR: if an item is hard-deleted from a content
location that is on hold, the item isn't permanently removed from Office 365. That
means it could conceivably be recovered by an IT admin. If your organization has a
requirement or policy that data be permanently deleted and unrecoverable in
Office 365 in response to DSR, then a hold would have to be removed from a
mailbox or site to permanently delete data in Office 365. More than likely, your
organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs have a process in place to
determine whether a specific DSR deletion request or a legal hold takes
precedence. If a hold is removed to delete items, it can be reimplemented after the
item is deleted.

Deleting documents in SharePoint and OneDrive for work
and school
After you find the document on a SharePoint site or in a OneDrive for work and school
account (by following the guidance in Discover section of this guide) that needs to be
deleted, a data privacy officer or IT admin would need to be assigned the necessary
permissions to access the site and delete the document. If appropriate, the document
owner can also be instructed to delete the document.

Here's the high-level process for deleting documents from sites.

1. Go to the site and locate the document.
2. Delete the document. When you delete a document from a site, it's sent to the

first-stage Recycle Bin.
3. Go to the first-stage Recycle Bin (the site Recycle Bin) and delete the same

document you deleted in the previous step. The document is sent to the second-
stage Recycle Bin. At this point, the document is soft-deleted.

4. Go to the second-stage Recycle Bin (which is the site collection Recycle Bin) and
delete the same document that you deleted from the first-stage Recycle Bin. At
this point, the document is hard-deleted.

） Important

You can't delete a document that is located on a site that is on hold (with one of
the retention or legal hold features in Office 365). In the case where a DSR delete



request takes precedence over a legal hold, the hold would have to be removed
from the site before a document could be permanently deleted.

See the following articles for detailed procedures.

Delete a file, folder, or link from a SharePoint document library
Delete items or empty the Recycle Bin of a SharePoint site
Delete items from the site collection recycle bin
"Get access to the former employee's OneDrive for work and school documents"
section in Get access to and back up a former user's data
Delete files or folders in OneDrive for work and school
Delete a list in SharePoint
Delete list items in SharePoint

Deleting a SharePoint site
You may determine that the best way to respond to a DSR delete request is to delete an
entire SharePoint site, which will delete all that data located in the site. You can do this
by running cmdlets in SharePoint PowerShell.

Use the Remove-SPOSite cmdlet to delete the site and move it the SharePoint
Recycle Bin (soft-delete).
Use the Remove-SPODeletedSite cmdlet to permanently delete the site (hard-
delete).

You can't delete a site that is placed on an eDiscovery hold or is assigned to a retention
policy. Sites must be removed from an eDiscovery hold or retention policy before you
can delete it.

Deleting a OneDrive for work and school site
Similarly, you may determine to delete a user's OneDrive for work and school site in
response to a DSR deletion request. If you delete the user's Office 365 account, their
OneDrive for work and school site is retained (and restorable) for 30 days. After 30 days,
it's moved to the SharePoint Recycle Bin (soft-deleted), and then after 93 days, it's
permanently deleted (hard-deleted). To accelerate this process, you can use the
Remove-SPOSite cmdlet to move the OneDrive for work and school site to the Recycle
Bin and then use the Remove-SPODeletedSite cmdlet to permanently delete it. As with
sites in SharePoint, you can't delete a user's OneDrive for work and school site if it was
assigned to an eDiscovery hold or a retention policy before the user's account was
deleted.



Deleting OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint
Experience Settings
In addition to user-created files stored in OneDrive for work and school accounts and
SharePoint sites, these services store information about the user that is used to enable
various experiences. These were previously documented in this document. See the
Additional considerations for selected applications section under Using the Content
Search eDiscovery tool to respond to DSRs for information about how to access, view,
and export OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint application data.

Deleting a SharePoint user profile
The SharePoint user profile will be permanently deleted 30 days after the user account is
deleted in Microsoft Entra ID. However, you can hard-delete the user account, which will
remove the SharePoint user profile. For more information, see the Deleting a user
section in this guide.

An admin can expedite the deletion of the User Profile for a user by using the Remove-
SPOUserProfile cmdlet in SharePoint PowerShell. See Remove-SPOUserProfile. This
requires the user to be at least soft-deleted in Microsoft Entra ID.

Deleting User Information lists on SharePoint sites
For users that have left the organization, this data remains in the sites they interacted
with for referential integrity of SharePoint column fields. An admin can delete all User
information properties for a user on a given site by using the Remove-SPOUserInfo
command in SharePoint PowerShell. See Remove-SPOUserInfo for information about
running this PowerShell cmdlet.

By default, this command retains the display name of the user and deleted properties
such as telephone number, email address, skills and expertise, or other properties that
were copied from the SharePoint user profile. An admin can use the RedactUser
parameter to specify an alternate display name for the user in the User Information list.
This affects several parts of the user experience and will result in information loss when
looking at the history of files in the site.

Finally, the redaction capability won't remove all metadata or content referencing a user
from documents. The way to achieve redaction of file content and metadata is described
in the Making changes to content in OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint
section in this guide. This method consists of downloading, deleting, and then
uploading a redacted copy of the file.



Deleting OneDrive for work and school experience settings
The recommended way to delete all OneDrive for work and school experience settings
and information is to remove the user's OneDrive for work and school site, after
reassigning any retained files to other users. An admin can delete these lists using
PowerShell Script and SharePoint Client-Side Object Model (CSOM) commands. See
Deleting OneDrive for work and school experience settings for more information about
the settings, how they're stored, and how to delete them.

OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint search queries
A user's search queries created in the OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint
search experience are automatically deleted 30 days after the user creates the query.

Deleting items in Exchange Online mailboxes
You may have to delete items in Exchange Online mailboxes to satisfy a DSR delete
request. There are two ways that an IT admin can delete items in mailbox, depending on
whether to soft-delete or hard-delete the target items. Like documents on SharePoint or
OneDrive for work and school sites, items in a mailbox that is on hold can't be
permanently deleted from Office 365. The hold must be removed before the item can be
deleted. Again, you'll have to determine whether the hold on the mailbox or the DSR
delete request takes precedence.

Soft-delete mailbox items
You can use the Content Search Action functionality to soft-delete items that are
returned by a Content Search. As previously explained, soft-deleted items are moved to
the Recoverable Items folder in the mailbox while hard-deleted items are permanently
deleted and can't be recovered.

Here's a quick overview of this process:

1. Create and run a Content Search to find the items that you want to delete from the
user mailbox. You may have to rerun the search to narrow that search results so
that only the items that you want to delete are returned in the search results.

2. Use the New-ComplianceSearchAction -Purge PurgeType SoftDelete or New-
ComplianceSearchAction -Purge PurgeType HardDelete command in Office 365
PowerShell to delete items that are returned by the Content Search that was
created in the previous step.

For detailed instructions, see Search for and delete email messages in your organization.



Hard-delete items in a mailbox on hold
As previously explained, if you hard-delete items in a mailbox on hold, items aren't
removed from the mailbox. They're moved to a hidden folder in the Recoverable Items
folder (the Purges folder) and will remain there until the hold duration for the item
expires or until the hold is removed from the mailbox. If either of those things happen,
the items will be purged from Office 365 the next time that the mailbox is processed.

Your organization might determine that items being permanently deleted when the hold
duration expires meets the requirements for a DSR deletion request. However, if you
determine that mailbox items must be immediately purged from Office 365, you would
have to remove the hold from the mailbox and then hard-deleted the items from the
mailbox. For detailed instructions, see Delete items in the Recoverable Items folder of
cloud-based mailboxes on hold.

７ Note

To hard-delete mailbox items to satisfy a DSR deletion request by following the
procedure in the previous topic, you may have to soft-delete those items while the
mailbox is still on hold so that they are moved to the Recoverable Items folder.

Deleting a user
In addition to deleting personal data in response to a DSR deletion request, a data
subject's "right to be forgotten" may also be fulfilled by deleting their user account.
Here are some reasons that you might want to delete a user:

The data subject has left (or is in the process of leaving) your organization.
The data subject has requested that you delete system-generated logs that have
been collected about them. Examples of data in system-generated logs include
Office 365 app and service usage data, information about search requests
performed by the data subject, and data generated by product and services as a
product of system functionality and interaction by users or other systems. For
more information, see Part 3: Responding to DSRs for system-generated Logs in
this guide.
Permanently prevent the data subject from accessing or processing data in Office
365 (as opposed to temporarily restriction access by the methods described in the
section Responding to DSR restriction requests.

After you delete a user account:



The user can no longer sign-in to Office 365 or access any of your organization's
Microsoft resources, such as their OneDrive for work and school account,
SharePoint sites, or their Exchange Online mailbox.
Personal data, such as email address, alias, phone number, and mailing address,
that's associated with the user account is deleted
Some Office 365 apps remove information about the user. For example, in
Microsoft Flow, the deleted user is removed from the list of owners for a shared
flow.
System-generated logs about the data subject, with the exception of data that may
compromise the security or stability of the service, will be deleted 30 days after the
user account is deleted. For more information, see the section Deleting system-
generated logs.

） Important

After you delete a user account, that person will lose the ability to sign in to Office
365 and the ability to sign in to any products or services for which he or she
formerly relied upon for a work or school account. That person would also be
unable to initiate any DSR requests through Microsoft directly in instances where
Microsoft is the data controller. For more information, see the Product and services
authenticated with an Org ID for which Microsoft is a data controller section in
Part 4 of this guide.

７ Note

In the event that you are a customer currently engaged in FastTrack migrations,
deleting the user account will not delete the data copy held by the Microsoft
FastTrack team, which is held for the sole purpose of completing the migration. If,
during the migration, you would like the Microsoft FastTrack team to also delete
the data copy, you can submit a request . In the ordinary course of business,
Microsoft FastTrack will delete all data copies once the migration is complete.

Like the soft-deletion and hard-deletion of data that was described in the previous
section on deleting personal data, when you delete a user account, there's also a soft-
deleted and hard-deleted state.

When you initially delete a user account (by deleting the user in the admin center
or in the Azure portal), the user account is soft-deleted, and moved the Recycle Bin
in Azure for up to 30 days. At this point, the user account can be restored.



If you permanently deleted the user account, the user account is hard-deleted and
removed from the Recycle Bin in Azure. At this point, the user account can't be
restored, and any data associated with the user account will be permanently
removed from the Microsoft cloud. Hard-deleting an account deletes system-
generated logs about the data subject, except for data that may compromise the
security or stability of the service.

Here's the high-level process for deleting a user from your organization.

1. Go to the admin center or the Azure portal and locate the user.

2. Delete the user. When you initially delete the user, the user's account is sent to the
Recycle Bin. At this point, the user is soft-deleted. The account is retained in the
soft-deleted for 30 days, which allows you to restore the account. After 30 days,
the account is automatically hard-deleted. For specific instructions, see Delete
users from Microsoft Entra ID.

You can also soft-delete a user account in the admin center. See Delete a user from
your organization.

3. If you don't want to wait for 30-days for the user account to be hard-deleted, you
can manually hard-delete it. To do this in the Azure portal, go to the Recently
deleted users list and permanently delete the user. At this point, the user is hard-
deleted. For instructions, see How to permanently delete a recently deleted user.

You can't hard-delete a user in the Office 365 admin portal.

７ Note

In Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), you can't permanently delete a user as
previously described. To permanently delete a user, you can submit a request via
the Office 365 admin portal at this URL . Go to Commerce and then select
Subscription -> Privacy -> GDPR and enter the required information.

Removing Exchange Online data
One thing to understand when deleting a user is what happens to the user's Exchange
Online mailbox. After the user account is hard-deleted (in step 3 in the previous process)
the deleted user's mailbox isn't automatically purged from Office 365. It takes up to 60
days after the user account is hard-deleted to permanently remove it from Office 365.
Here's the mailbox lifecycle after the user account is deleted and a description of the
state of the mailbox data during that time:



Day 1-Day 30:The mailbox can be fully restored by restoring the soft-deleted user
account.
Day 31-Day 60:For 30 days after the user account is hard-deleted, an admin in your
organization can recover the data in the mailbox and import it into a different
mailbox. This provides organizations the ability to recover the mailbox data if
necessary.
Day 61-Day 90: An admin can no longer recover the data in the mailbox. The
mailbox data is marked for permanent removal, and it takes up to 30 more days
for the mailbox data to be purged from Office 365.

If you determine that this mailbox lifecycle doesn't meet your organization's
requirements for responding to a DSR deletion request, you can contact Microsoft
Support  after you hard-delete the user account, and request Microsoft to manually
initiate the process to permanently remove the mailbox data. This process to
permanently remove mailbox data starts automatically after day 61 in the lifecycle, so
there would be no reason to contact Microsoft after this point in the lifecycle.

Using In-App functionality to respond to DSRs
While most Customer Data is authored and produced using the applications described
in the previous section, Office 365 also offers many other applications that customers
can use to produce and store Customer Data. However, Content Search doesn't
currently have the ability to find data authored in these other Office 365 applications. To
find data generated by these applications, you or the data owner must use in-product
functionality or features to find data that may be relevant to a DSR. The following list
identifies these Office 365 applications.

Applications where in-app functionality can be used to find Customer Data:

Access
Business App for Office 365
Education
Power Automate
Forms
Planner
Power Apps
Power BI
Project
Publisher
Stream
Sway



Viva Engage
Viva Glint
Viva Goals
Viva Learning
Viva Pulse

Access
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Access to
find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover

There are several ways that you can search for records in an Access database that might
be responsive to a DSR request. For a DSR investigation, you can search for records that
related to the data subject or search for records that contain specific data. For example,
you could either search or go to a record that corresponds to the data subject. Or you
can search for records that contain specific data, such as personal data about the data
subject. For more information, see:

Find records in an Access database
Create a simple select query

Access

After you find the records or fields that are relevant to the DSR request, you can take a
screenshot of the data or export it to an Excel file, Word file, or a text file. You can also
create and print a report based on a record source, or a select query that you created to
find the data. See:

Introduction to reports in Access
Export data to Excel
Export data to a Word document
Export data to a text file

Export

As previously explained, you can export data from an Access database to different file
formats. The export file format that you choose might be determined by the specific
DSR export request from a data subject. See Import and export  for a list of articles
that describe how to export Access data in different file formats.



Delete

You can delete an entire record or just a field from an Access database. The quickest way
to delete a record from an Access database is to open the table in Datasheet view, select
the record (row) or just the data in a field that you want to delete, and then press
Delete. You can also use a select query that you created to find data and then convert it
to a delete query. See:

Delete one or more records from a database
Create and run a delete query

Business Apps for Office 365
This section explains how to use the in-app functionality in each of the following
Business Apps for Office 365 to respond to DSR requests.

Bookings
Listings
Connections

Bookings
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Bookings
to find, access, export, and delete personal data. This applies to both the standalone
Bookings app and to Bookings when accessed through the Business center.

Microsoft Bookings allows administrators and users or staff, with a Bookings license in
their organization, to set up booking pages so customers can schedule and make
changes to appointments, receive confirmation emails, updates, cancellation, and
reminders email. Business owners and their staff can also book events on behalf of their
customers with Bookings.

The following types of data are created by customers, administrators, or staff:

Contact information of customers, partners, and friends - This data contains
name, phone number, email address, address, and notes.

Contacts for anyone can be manually created by using the Bookings Web, iOS,
and Android clients.

Contacts for anyone can be imported from a C1's mobile device into Bookings
with the Bookings iOS and Android clients.



Contacts are also autocreated at the time of booking creation through the
booking workflow for anyone booked, whether the booking is created by a user
on a customer's behalf or if it's created by the customer using the owner's
booking page.

Booking events - These are meetings between the business owner or their
designated staff and a customer, which are created either by the business owner or
the customer through the business owner's public booking page. This data
includes name, address, email address, phone number, and any other info the
business owner collects from the customer at the time of booking.

Email confirmations/cancellations/updates - These are email messages generated
and sent by the system in association with specific booking events. They contain
personal data about the staff who is scheduled to deliver the relevant service and
they contain personal data about the customer that was entered by either the
business owner or the customer at the time of booking.

All customer content is stored in the Exchange Online mailbox that hosts the
organization's Bookings. This content is retained for as long as the business owner and
customer are active in the service, unless they explicitly request that the data be deleted
or if they leave the service. This content can be deleted with in-product UI, with a
cmdlet, or through deletion of the relevant booking mailbox. Once the deleted action is
initiated, the data is deleted within the time period set by the business owner.

If a customer decides to leave the service, their customer contents is deleted after 90
days. For more information about when mailbox content is deleted after a user account
in deleted, see Removing Exchange Online data.

End User Identifiable Information
End user Identifiable Information (EUII) includes personal and contact information about
the staff that gets scheduled in Bookings. It's added to the Staff details pages when the
business owner sets up Bookings and makes updates after the setup. It contains staff
member's name, initials, email address, and phone number. This data is stored in the
Exchange Online mailbox that hosts Bookings.

This data is retained for as long as the staff member is active in the service unless it's
explicitly deleted the business owner or an admin using the in-app UI or by deleting the
relevant booking mailbox. When the admin initiates the deletion of staff's details, or if
the staff member leaves the service, their details are deleted in accordance with the
Exchange Online mailbox's content retention policies set by the business owner or
admin.



Discover/Access

Bookings gather and store the following types of data:

Business profile information: Customer content about the business using
Bookings is collected through the Bookings' Business information form and is
synchronized with the Business Center Business Profile if a customer is using
Bookings along with the Business center. The only EUII associated with this data is
an email address of the C1. This address is where new booking notifications and
update emails are sent.
Customer contacts: Contacts can be manually created in the Bookings Web, iOS,
and Android clients, or they can be imported from a mobile device. Contacts are
also automatically created during the use of the self-service booking page. They
contain EUII and are stored in the Bookings mailbox.
Staff details: Customer content includes data about the staff that are eligible to
deliver the services created from either the Bookings Web, iOS, or Android clients.
Staff details can contain name, email address, and phone number.
Booking events: These are customer meetings and related customer content
created by the business using a Web client or Android/iOS app, or created by the
customer using a public booking page (or a Facebook page). These events can
include name, address, email address, phone number, and appointment details.
Meeting requests, email confirmations/cancellations/updates, and email
reminders: These are email messages sent by the system in association with
bookings. They contain staff data and customer data that was entered at time of
booking.

Export

To export data corresponding to the business owner, staff, and customers, you can use
the Business center privacy portal .

Delete

You can delete the following types of Bookings data in response to a DSR deleting
request:

Business profile information and contacts: You can delete the Bookings mailbox in
the admin center. After you delete the mailbox, you can restore it with 30 days.
After 30 days, the account and the corresponding mailbox are permanently
deleted. For details about deleting a user account, see the section Deleting a user.
Staff details: You can delete staff from the Bookings dashboard. To permanently
detail staff, you can delete their Office 365 account.



Bookings events: You can delete bookings events from the Bookings calendar,
which will remove the customer's information.
Meeting requests, email confirmations/cancellations/updates, and email
reminders: You can delete these from the Bookings calendar, which will remove
the customer's information.

To export data corresponding to the business owner, staff, and customers, you can use
the Business center privacy portal .

Additionally, you can delete business owner and staff data, you can delete the
corresponding user account. See the section Deleting a user.

Listings
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Listings
to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover

Listings owner can connect their business to Google, Bing, Yelp, and Facebook to see an
aggregated view of ratings and reviews. Listings collect and store the following types of
data:

Google reviews and ratings
Bing reviews and ratings
Yelp reviews and ratings
Facebook reviews and ratings

Access

Listings owner can sign in to the Listings dashboard to see their reviews and ratings.

Export

To export data corresponding to the business owner, staff, and customers, you can use
the Business center privacy portal .

Delete

If a Listings owner would like to delete their Listings information, they can disconnect
from the provider on the Listings page. After they disconnect, their Listings information
will be deleted.



Connections
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft
Connections to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover

Connections collect and store the following types of data:

Customers/contacts are created by the business using the web client or mobile
app (iOS, Android), or by using the app when a business contact is sent an email
marketing campaign. Customer data can include name, address, email address,
and tax ID numbers. Contacts are shared across all Business center apps.
Customers can sign up on the Connections sign-up page and save their personal
information.
Links from email campaigns

Access

A Connections owner can sign in to the Connections dashboard and see the email
campaigns they've sent.

Export

To export data corresponding to the business owner, staff, and customers, you can use
the Business center privacy portal .

Delete

After a Connections owner sends an email campaign, they can't delete the campaign. If
there are any draft campaigns they want to delete, they can sign in to the Connections
dashboard and delete the draft campaigns.

Assignments and OneNote Class Notebook
This section explains how to use the in-app functionality of the following Microsoft
Education apps to respond to DSR requests.

Assignments
Class Notebook



Assignments
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Assignments to
find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover/Access

Assignments stores information that is generated both by teachers and students. Some
of this information is store in SharePoint and some is stored in a non-SharePoint
location.

Finding Assignments data stored in SharePoint

Students files associated with a Submission for Assignment are stored in a document
library (named Student Work) and files associated with Assignments that are created by
teachers and (accessible by students) are stored in a different document library (named
Class Files). Both document libraries are in the corresponding Class Team SharePoint
site.

An admin can use the Content Search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to
search for student files (in the Student Work and Class Files libraries) that are related to
submissions on assignments and files related to assignments. For example, an admin
could search all SharePoint sites in the organization and use the student's name and
class or assignment name in the search query to find data relevant to a DSR request.

Similarly, an admin can search for teacher files related to assignments for files that a
teacher distributed to students. For example, an admin could search all SharePoint sites
in the organization and use the teacher's name and class or assignment name in the
search query to find data relevant to a DSR request.

For more information, see:

Assignments Admin Documentation
Using the Content Search eDiscovery tool to respond to DSRs (in this guide)

Finding Assignments data not stored in SharePoint

The following types of Assignments data aren't stored in the class team SharePoint site,
and therefore aren't discoverable by using Content Search. This data this includes the
following:

Student grades and feedback from the teacher
The list of documents submitted for an assignment by each student



Assignment details, like the date the assignment is due

To find data, an admin or a teacher would have to go into the Assignment in the Class
Team site to find data that may be relevant to a DSR request. An admin can add
themselves as an owner to the class and view all the assignments for that class team.

Even if a student is no longer part of a class, their data might still be present in the class
and marked as "no longer enrolled". In this case, a student submitting a DSR request
would have to provide the admin the list of classes that they were formally enrolled it.

Export

You can export Assignments data for a specific student for all classes in which the
student is enrolled by using a PowerShell script to get a list of classes for the student
and then using a PowerShell script to export the data. See:

Configure Assignments for Teams
Get a list of classes for a specific student
Export student and teacher data from Assignments

If the student has been removed from the Team Class site, the admin can add the
student back to the site before running the export script. Or the admin can use the input
file for the script to identify every class that the student was ever enrolled in. You can
also use the Assignment export script to export submissions data for all assignments
that a teacher has access to.

Delete

You can delete Assignments data for a specific student for all classes in which the
student is enrolled by using a PowerShell script to get a list of classes for the student
and then using a PowerShell script to delete the data. You should do this before you
remove the student from the class. See:

Configure Assignments for Teams
Get a list of classes for a specific student
Delete student data from Assignments

If the student has been removed from the Team Class site, the admin can add the
student back to the site before running the export script. Or the admin can use the input
file for the script to identify every class that the student was ever enrolled in. You can't
use the Assignments deletion script to delete teacher data because all Assignments are
shared across the Class Team site. As an alternative, an admin would have to add
themselves to the Class Team site and then delete a specific Assignment.



Class Notebook
Searching for content in Class Notebook is discussed previously in this guide. See the
OneNote Class Notebook section. You can also use the Content Search tool to export
data from a Class Notebook. Alternatively, an admin or the data subject can export data
from a Class Notebook. See Save a copy of a Class Notebook .

Power Automate
Power Automate provides tools and resources to help you respond to requests to
correct, export, or delete personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud. Please see
Responding to DSR requests for Power automate customer data for more to enable end
users GDPR rights for customer data collected when using Power automate
infrastructure in your organization.

Forms
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Forms to
find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
Forms users can go to https://forms.office.com  and select My forms to see the Forms
they've created. They can also select Shared with me to view Forms others have shared
via a link. If there are many Forms to sort through, users can use the in-product search
bar to search for Forms by title or author. To determine whether Microsoft Forms is a
place where personal data responsive to your DSR is likely to reside, you can ask the
Data Subject to search his or her Shared with me list to determine which users ("Forms
owners") have sent Forms to the Data Subject. You can then ask the forms owners to
select Collaborate or Duplicate in the top navigation bar and send you a link to a
specific form so you can view it and further determine whether it's material to your DSR.

Access
After the relevant Forms are found, you can access the responses to the Form by clicking
the Responses tab. Learn more about how to check your quiz results  or form
results . To review response results in Excel, select the Responses tab, and then select
Open in Excel. If you would like to send the Data Subject a copy of the Form, you can
either take screenshots of the relevant questions and answers that are in shown in the
application in rich text format or send the Data Subject an Excel copy of the results. If
you're using Excel and would like to share with the Data Subject only portions of the



survey result, you can delete certain rows or columns or redact the remaining sections
before sharing the results. Alternatively, you can go to Collaborate or Duplicate > Get a
link to duplicate (under Share as a template) to provide the Data Subject with a
replicate of the entire Form.

Delete
Any survey, quiz, questionnaire, or poll can be permanently deleted by its owner. If you
would like to honor a DSR "forget me" and delete a form in its entirety, find the Form in
the list of forms, select the series of dots (ellipsis) in the upper right corner of the form
preview window, and then select Delete. Once a Form is deleted, it can't be retrieved.
For information, see Delete a Form .

Export
To export form questions and responses to an Excel file, open the form, select the
Responses tab, and then select Open in Excel.

Planner
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Planner
to find, access, export, and delete personal data. Planner data includes core task, plan,
and bucket data, like titles, descriptions, dates, and so on. Comments on a task are
conversations stored in Exchange. Uploaded attachments are stored in SharePoint. Refer
to those workloads for info on discovering or exporting comments or attachments.

Discover
Planner users can go to the Planner site  to view their plans and tasks assigned to
them. When an admin searches for content on behalf of a user, they can use the process
described in the "Export" section to find content related to the user.

Access
The same process to discover data also provides access to the data, either through the
Planner site or the export process.

Delete



You can manually delete a user's personally information by either giving yourself
permissions to access the plans the user is part of or signing in as the user to make the
changes. See Delete user data in Microsoft Planner .

Export
You can use a PowerShell script to export a user's data from Planner. When you export
the data, a separate JSON file is export for each plan that the user is a part of. See
Export user data from Microsoft Planner .

Power BI
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Power BI
to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
You can search for content in the different workspaces in Power BI, including
dashboards, reports, workbooks, and datasets. Each type of workspace contains a search
field that you can use to search that workspace. See Searching, finding, and sorting
content in Power BI service.

Access
You can print dashboards, reports, and visuals from reports in Power BI to produce a
physical copy. You can't print entire reports; you can only print one page at a time. To do
this, go to a report, use the search field to find specific data, and then print that page.
See Printing from Power BI service.

Delete
To delete dashboards, reports, and workbooks, see Delete almost anything in Power BI
service.

Deleting a dashboard, report, or workbook doesn't delete the underlying dataset.
Because Power BI relies on a live connection to the underlying source data to be
complete and accurate, deleting personal data must be done there. (For example, if you
created a Power BI report that is connected to Dynamics 365 for Sales as the live data
source, you would have to make any corrections to the data in Dynamics 365 for Sales.)



After the data is deleted, you can use the scheduled data refresh capabilities in Power BI
to update the dataset that is stored in Power BI, after which the deleted data will no
longer be reflected in any Power BI reports or dashboards that used that data. To help
comply with GDPR requirements, you should have policies in place to ensure that you're
refreshing your data at an appropriate cadence.

Export
To facilitate a data portability request, you can export dashboards and reports in Power
BI:

You can export the underlying data for dashboards and reports to a static Excel file.
See the video in Printing from Power BI service. Using Excel, you can then edit the
personal data to be included in the portability request, and save it in a commonly
used, machine-readable format such as .csv or .xml.
You can export (download) a report from the Power BI service in Office 365 to a
.pbix file if it was originally published using Power BI Desktop. You can then import
this file to Power BI Desktop and publish (export) it to the Power BI service of
another organization. See Export a report from Power BI service to Desktop.

PowerApps
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Power
Apps to find, access, export, and delete personal data. These steps outline how an admin
can transition apps and their dependent resources to new owners to limit business
disruption.

Discover
PowerApps is a service for building apps that can be shared and used within your
organization. As a part of the process of building or running an app, a user ends up
storing several types of resources and data in the PowerApps service, including apps,
environments, connections, custom connectors, and permissions.

To help facilitate a DSR request related to PowerApps, you can use the administration
operations exposed in the PowerApps Admin Center  and PowerApps Admin
PowerShell cmdlets .

For more information about finding personal data, see Discover PowerApps personal
data .



The PowerApps service also includes the Common Data Service For Apps, which enables
users to store data in standard and custom entities within a Common Data Service
database. You can view the data stored in these entities from the PowerApps Maker
portal , and use the in-product search capabilities of Advanced Find to search for
specific data in the entity. For more information around discovering personal data in the
Common Data Service, see Discover Common Data Service personal data .

Access
Admins have the ability to assign themselves privileges to access and run the apps and
associated resources (including flows, connections, and custom connectors) using the
PowerApps Admin Center  or PowerApps Admin PowerShell cmdlets .

After you have access to the user's app, you can use a web browser to open the app.
After you open an app, you can take a screenshot of the data. See Use PowerApps in a
web browser.

Delete
Because PowerApps allow users to build line-of-business application that can be a
critical part of your organization's day-to-day operations, when a user leaves your
organization and their Office 365 account is deleted, the admin needs to determine
whether to delete the apps owned by the user or reassign to new owners. This is to help
your organization transition apps to new owners and avoid any disruption to your
business for apps that may be used for shared business processes.

For shared data, like apps, admins must decide whether to permanently delete that
user's shared data or keep them by reassigning the data to themselves or someone else
within their organization. See Delete PowerApps personal data .

Any data that was stored by a user in an entity in a Common Data Service For Apps
database will also need to be reviewed and (if desired) deleted by an admin using the
in-product capabilities. See Delete Common Data Service user personal data .

Export
Admins have the ability to export personal data stored for a user within the PowerApps
service using the PowerApps Admin Center  and PowerApps Admin PowerShell
cmdlets . See Export PowerApps personal data .

You can also use the in-product search capabilities of Advanced Find to search for a
user's personal data in any entity. For details about exporting personal data in the



Common Data Service, see Export Common Data Service personal data .

Connections and custom connectors in PowerApps
Connections require users to provide credentials to connect to APIs, SaaS applications,
and custom developed systems. These connections are owned by the user that
established the connection and can be managed in-product. After PowerApps have
been reassigned, an admin can use PowerShell cmdlets to list and delete these
connections as part of deleting user data.

Custom connectors allow organizations to extend the capabilities of PowerApps by
connecting to systems where an out-of-box connector isn't available. A custom
connector author can share their connector with others in an organization. After
receiving a DSR deleting request, an admin should consider reassigning ownership of
these connectors to avoid business disruption. To expedite this process, an admin can
use PowerShell cmdlets to list, reassign, or delete custom connectors.

Project Online
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Project
Online to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover and access
You can use Content Search to search the SharePoint site that's associated with a Project
(when a Project is first created, there's an option to create an associated SharePoint site);
Content Search doesn't search the data in an actual project in Project Online, only the
associated site. Though Content Search searches for metadata about projects such as
people mentioned in the subject) However, this may help you find (and access) the
Project that contains the data related to the DSR.

 Tip

The URL for the site collection in your organization where sites associated with
Projects is https://<your org>.sharepoint.com/sites/pwa ; for example,
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/pwa . You can use this specific site collection as
the location of your content search and then the name of the Project in the search
query. Additionally, an IT admin can use the Site Collections page in the SharePoint
admin center to get a list of PWA site collections in the organization.



Delete
You can delete information about a user from your Project Online environment. See
Delete user data from Project Online .

Export
You can a specific user's content from your Project Online environment. This data is
exported to multiple files in the JSON format. For step-by instructions see, Export user
data from Project Online . For detailed information about the files that are exported,
see Project Online export json object definitions .

Publisher
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Publisher
to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
You can use the in-app search feature to find text in a Publisher file the same way as you
can in most Office applications. See Find and replace text .

Access
After you find data, you can take a screenshot of it or copy and paste it into a Word or
text file and provide that to the data subject. You can also save a publication as a Word,
PDF, or XPS file. See:

Save a publication as a Word document
Save As or convert a publication to .pdf or .xps using Publisher

Export
You can provide a data subject with the actual Publisher file or as previously explained,
you can save a publication as a Word, PDF, or XPS file. See:

Save a publication as a Word document
Save As or convert a publication to .pdf or .xps using Publisher

Delete



You can delete content from a publication, delete entire pages, or delete an entire
Publisher file. See Add or delete pages .

Stream
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Stream
to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
To discover content that is generated or uploaded to Stream that may be relevant to a
data subject request, a Stream admin can run a user report to determine what videos,
video descriptions, groups, channels, or comments a Stream user may have uploaded,
created, or posted by a user. For instructions on how to generate a report, see
Managing user data in Microsoft Stream. The report output is in HTML format and
contains hyperlinks that can be used to navigate to videos of potential interest. If you
would like to view a video that has custom permission set and you aren't part of the
original users for whom the video was intended, you can view in admin mode, See
Admin capabilities in Microsoft Stream.

Access
Depending on the nature of the data subject request, a copy of the report described
above can be used to help satisfy a data subject request. The user report includes the
Stream user's name and unique ID, a list of videos the user uploaded, a list of videos the
user has access to, a list of channels the user created, a list of all the groups the user is a
member of, and a list of all comments the user left on videos. The report further shows
whether the user viewed each video listed in the user report. If you would like to provide
the data subject with access to a video to satisfy a DSR request, you can share the video.

Export
See the Access section for Stream.

Delete
To delete or edit videos or any other Stream content, a Stream admin can select view in
admin mode to perform the necessary function. See Admin capabilities in Microsoft
Stream. If a user has left the organization and would like to have their name removed



from appearing next to videos that they uploaded, you can remove their name or
replace it with another. See Managing deleted users in Microsoft Stream.

Sway
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Sway to
find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
Content created using Sway (found at www.sway.com ) can only be seen by the owner
and those that the author has permitted to view the Sway. See Privacy Settings in
Sway . To determine whether Sway is a place where personal data responsive to your
DSR is likely to reside, you can ask the Data Subject and organizational users who are
likely to have generated content about the Data Subject to search their Sways and share
with you any Sways that are likely to contain personal data responsive to the Data
Subject's request. For information on how to share a Sway, see "Share a Sway from your
Organizational Account" in this Share your Sway  article.

Access
If you have found personal data in a Sway that you would like to share with the Data
Subject, you can provide the Data Subject with access to the data through one of several
means. You can provide the Data Subject a copy of the online version of Sway (as
described above); you can take screenshots of the relevant portion of the Sway that you
would like to share; or you can print or download the Sway to Word or convert it to a
PDF. How to download a Sway is further described in the "export" section below.

Delete
To learn how to delete a Sway, go to the "How do I delete my Sway?" section in Privacy
settings in Sway .

Export
To export a Sway, open the Sway that you would like to download, select the series of
dots (ellipsis) in the upper right corner, select Export, and then choose either Word or
PDF.

Whiteboard



Whiteboard content is stored in OneDrive and Azure. OneDrive is the default storage for
all new Whiteboards, except for a few cases and tenants where Whiteboards initiated on
Surface Hub or Microsoft Teams Room devices are stored on Azure. Whiteboards
originally created in Azure are stored in Azure.

All Whiteboards will transition to OneDrive storage. Whiteboards currently in Azure will
be moved to OneDrive according to the Microsoft 365 Roadmap .

See the DSR instructions below for:

Whiteboard stored in One Drive for Business
Whiteboard stored in Azure

Whiteboard stored in OneDrive
Whiteboards are created in the OneDrive folder of the person who starts the
whiteboard. SharePoint isn't yet supported. This process applies to all Whiteboards
created in the standalone Whiteboard applications, and in Microsoft Teams meetings,
chats, and channels. Whiteboards started from a Surface Hub are stored in Azure,
though they'll be moved to OneDrive in accordance with the roadmap.

You can use existing OneDrive tooling to satisfy data subject requests (DSRs) for GDPR.
Whiteboard files are moved in the same way as other content in OneDrive.

Discover

Whiteboard files (.whiteboard files) are stored in users' OneDrive for work and school
account. You can ask the data subject or other users if the Whiteboards they created
may contain personal data applicable to a DSR request. They can share a whiteboard
with you, or you can get a copy of it to give to the data subject.

To access and transfer Whiteboards:

1. Give yourself access to the user's OneDrive for work and school account. See the
"Get access to the former employee's OneDrive for work and school documents"
section in Get access to and back up a former user's data

2. Go to the Whiteboard App Data folder in the user's OneDrive for work and school
account and copy the .Whiteboard files of the Whiteboards that you want to
transfer.

3. Give yourself access to the data subject's OneDrive for work and school account,
and then go to Whiteboard App Data folder.

4. Paste the .whiteboard files that you copied in the previous step.



Access

If you find personal data in a whiteboard that's responsive to a DSR access request, you
can provide the data subject access to a whiteboard in several ways:

Take screenshots of the relevant portions of a whiteboard.
Upload a copy of the .whiteboard file to the data subject's OneDrive for work and
school account. See the previous section for steps on accessing and transferring
.wbx files.
Export a copy of whiteboard as a .png file.

Export

If you've obtained a copy of a whiteboard, you can export it.

1. Select Share and then select Export a copy. You can export a whiteboard to an
image (.png) file.

Delete

You can give yourself access to the user's OneDrive for work and school account and
then delete the Whiteboards.

1. Give yourself access to the user's OneDrive for work and school account. See the
"Get access to the former employee's OneDrive for work and school documents"
section in Get access to and back up a former user's data

2. Go to the Whiteboard App Data folder and then delete the contents.

Transfer whiteboard when a user leaves the company
To preserve a former user's OneDrive files, including .whiteboard files, first give yourself
access to their OneDrive, and then move the files you want to keep.

1. In the admin center, go to the Users > Active users  page.
2. Select a user.
3. On the user properties page, select OneDrive. Under Get access to files,

select Create link to files.
4. Select the link to open the file location.
5. Select the files or folders that you want to move, and then select Move to.

To learn more about preserving a former user’s content, see Step 5 - Give another
employee access to OneDrive and Outlook data.



Manage moved Whiteboards
Once the .whiteboard file appears in the OneDrive for Business of the new owner, they
can open, edit, rename, or delete the files.

1. Open office.com and in the app launcher, select OneDrive.
2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select My Files.
3. Open the folder named Whiteboards.
4. In the list of files, select the moved file and select the ... button to get rename,

delete, and other options.

Whiteboard stored in Azure
This content stored in Azure can be managed using Whiteboard PowerShell cmdlets.
Eventually, Whiteboards stored in Azure need to be migrated to OneDrive for Business
or deleted.

If an admin receives a DSR request for data in the new Whiteboard app, they can use
Whiteboard PowerShell to add themselves (or other users) as an owner of a user's
Whiteboards. This enables an admin to perform actions including accessing, exporting,
and deleting Whiteboards. Use either the Set-WhiteboardOwner cmdlet to add yourself
or another user as the owner of a whiteboard or use the Invoke-
TransferAllWhiteboards cmdlet to transfer the ownership of all Whiteboards for a
specific user to a new owner. For information about using these cmdlets and installing
the Whiteboard PowerShell module, see the Microsoft Whiteboard cmdlet reference.
After you or another person has ownership of a Whiteboard, see Export transfer or
delete Whiteboards  for steps on exporting and deleting a Whiteboard.

Viva Engage
The following sections explain how to use the in-app functionality in Microsoft Viva
Engage to find, access, export, and delete personal data.

Discover
From the Viva Engage admin center, a Viva Engage verified admin can export data
pertaining to a given user. The export includes the messages and files posted and
modified by the user, and information about articles and groups created by the user.
When a user-specific data export is run, the admin will also receive an inbox message
with the user's account activity data that they can provide to the user if they so choose.



For detailed instructions, see Manage GDPR data subject requests in Viva Engage
Enterprise.

User-specific exports are for a single network, so if the user is in an external Viva Engage
network, the admin must export data for that external network, and for the home
network.

To access data not included in data export, screenshots can be taken for the user's
profile, settings, group memberships, bookmarked messages, followed users, and
followed articles. Users or admins can collect this information. For more information, see
Overview of security and compliance in Viva Engage.

Access and export
You can view data in the exported files, including the full text of messages and the
contents of files. You can also select links in the exported files to go directly to the
posted messages and files in Viva Engage, and to groups, and articles the user created,
messages the user liked, messages where the user is @mentioned, polls the user has
voted on, and links the user has added.

Per-user data export doesn't include:

The user's profile:

If the user has a Viva Engage identity, the user has full control of their profile.
For information on how to view and modify the profile, see Change my Viva
Engage profile and settings .

If the user has an Office 365 identity, the Viva Engage user profile is pulled
automatically from Office 365, which gets the profile information from Microsoft
Entra ID. Viva Engage users can temporarily change their profiles in Viva
Engage, but these changes are overwritten when there's a change in Microsoft
Entra ID, so you must view and change directory data in Microsoft Entra ID. See
Manage Viva Engage users across their lifecycle from Office 365 and Add or
change profile information for a user in Microsoft Entra ID.

The user's settings:

The user can view and change their own settings. For information on how to view
and modify user settings, see Change my Viva Engage profile and settings . An
admin can view this information and take screenshots, but can't change it. Go to
Viva Engage settings > People, and then select the name of the user.



The user's group membership, bookmarked messages, followed users, and
followed articles.

An admin can view this information and take screenshots, but can't change it.
Go to Viva Engage settings > People, and then select the name of the user.

For instructions for how to export data, see Manage GDPR data subject requests in Viva
Engage. You must run a per-user export for each Viva Engage network the user is a
member of.

Viva Engage has data retention settings that either soft-delete or hard-delete data when
a user deletes a message or file. If this is set to soft-delete, data a user has deleted will
be included in the export. If the Viva Engage data retention setting is set to hard-delete,
the deleted information is no longer stored in Viva Engage, so won't be included in the
export.

Delete
Viva Engage allows verified admins to execute a GDPR-compliant delete via the Viva
Engage admin center if they receive a DSR. This option is called Erase User, and it
suspends the user for 14 days and then removes all their personal data, excluding files
and messages. If the user is a guest user, this must be done for each external network
the guest is a member of.

７ Note

If an admin wants to remove the files and messages of a user during the 14-day
window, they will have to perform a user level export to identify the files and
messages, and then decide which ones to delete either by in-product deletion or by
using a PowerShell script. After the 14-day window, the admin can no longer
associate the user with their files or messages.

When a user is deleted with the Erase User option, notification is sent to the Viva
Engage Inbox of all network admins and verified admins. The Erase User option deletes
the user's Viva Engage profile, but doesn't delete their Office 365 or Microsoft Entra
profile.

For detailed steps to remove a user, see Manage GDPR data subject requests in Viva
Engage.

must have a value, and all attributes that need to be deleted must be set to empty (for
String type, set to ", and for Integer type, set to -1). Keep all other attributes unchanged.
Please see Delete User Organizational data for more.

Once new Organizational Data is uploaded for an end user, that user's previously
ingested Organizational Data will be deleted within seven days.

Responding to DSR rectification requests
If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your
organization's data stored in Office 365, you and your organization have to determine
whether it's appropriate to honor the request. If you choose to honor the request, then
rectifying the data may include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing
personal data from a document or other type or item. The most expedient way to do
this is to ask the data/document owner to use the appropriate Office 365 application to
make the requested change. An alternative is to have an IT admin in your organization
make the change. This will probably require the IT admin (or other people in your
organization with the appropriate privileges, such as a SharePoint site collection
administrator) to assign to themselves or someone else working on the DSR the
necessary permissions to gain access to the document or the content location where the
document is located to make the change directly to the document.



Requesting that the data owner to make the approved
change
The most direct way to rectify personal data is to ask the data owner to make the
change. After you locate the data that is the subject of the DSR, you can provide the
following information so that they can make the change.

The location and file name (for documents and other files) of the item that needs
to be changed. Locating the data in question is part of the discovery process
discovery process that was previously explained.
The approved change the data owner should make

You may want to consider implementing a confirmation process where you or another
person involved in the DSR investigation verifies that the requested change has been
made.

Gaining access to a SharePoint site or OneDrive for work
and school account to make changes
If it's not feasible for the data owner to implement the data subject's request for
rectification, an IT admin or SharePoint admin in your organization can get access to the
content location and make the required changes. Or, an admin can assign you or
another data privacy officer the necessary permissions.

SharePoint
To assign administrator or owner permissions to a SharePoint site so that you or
someone else can access and edit that document, see

Manage administrators for a site collection

Edit and manage permissions for a SharePoint list or library

OneDrive for work and school
A SharePoint administrator or a Tenant admin can access a user's OneDrive for work and
school account by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Sign in to Office 365 admin center with your admin credentials.

2. Go to Active users and select the user.

3. Click OneDrive in the menu pane, and then select Access files.



4. select the URL to go to the user's OneDrive for work and school account.

Gaining access to an Exchange Online mailbox to make
changes to data
Administrators can assign themselves the permissions necessary to open and edit (or
delete) items in another user's mailbox, as if they were the mailbox owner.
Administrators can also assign these permissions to another user. For details, see:

Give mailbox permissions to another user in Office 365
Access another person's mailbox

If the user mailbox is place on a legal hold or has been assigned to a retention policy, all
versions of a mailbox are retained until the retention period expires or the hold is
removed from the mailbox. That means if a mailbox item is changed in response to DSR
rectification request, a copy of original item (before the change was made) is retained
and stored in a hidden folder in the Recoverable Items folder in the user's mailbox.

Making changes to content in OneDrive for work and
school and SharePoint
Admins or data owners can make changes to SharePoint documents, lists, and pages.
Keep the following things in mind when making changes to SharePoint content:

Updating a document saves a new version of the document, which will contain the
revision. Older versions of the document won't be updated. That means it's
possible that the data that's the subject of a DSR rectification request may persist
in older versions of the article. Older versions of an article can be deleted and then
permanently removed from Office 365. See the Deleting documents in SharePoint
and OneDrive for work and school section in this guide.

To completely redact a SharePoint file in a way that removes all traces of a data
subject from the file, including all versions of the file and all recorded activity
performed by the data subject, you have to perform the following steps:

1. Download a copy of the file to your local computer.
2. Permanently delete the file from SharePoint, by deleting the file, and then

deleting if from the first-stage and second-stage Recycle Bin. See the
Deleting documents in SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school section
in this guide.

3. Make the revisions to the copy of the document on your local computer.
4. Upload the revised file to the original SharePoint location.



Data in SharePoint lists can be edited. See Add, edit, or delete list items .

IT admins can also correct certain personal properties associated with a document:

User information from the SharePoint User Profile or Office 365 is often associated with
OneDrive for work and school and SharePoint documents to represent that person. For
example, a user's name in a Created By or Modified By People column for a document
or list item. This user information can be rectified in several ways, depending on the
source:

Rectify user properties in their own on-premises Active Directory. For customers
syncing user properties such as user Display Name, First Name, etc. from an on-
premises AD, those properties should be rectified there. Appropriately mapped
properties flow into Office 365, and then OneDrive for work and school and
SharePoint.
Rectify user properties in the admin center. Changes made to account information
there will automatically be reflected in OneDrive for work and school and
SharePoint experiences. For info, see Add or change profile information for a user
in Microsoft Entra ID . For properties sourced in Office 365, no changes can be
made on the SharePoint side.
Rectify user properties in the SharePoint user profile experience of the SharePoint
admin center. In the user profiles tab of the SharePoint admin center, admins can
select Manage user profiles, and look up any user's properties. Then they can
choose to Edit the user's properties.
Rectify user properties in a custom source. Custom SharePoint profile properties
may be syncing from a custom source via Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) or
another method.

This won't affect all experiences, which may retain the older information. For example,
the user's name as text in the document.

Making changes to content in Power BI
Power BI relies on the underlying source data used in its dashboards and reports to be
complete and accurate, so correcting inaccurate or incomplete source data must be
done there. For example, if you created a Power BI report that is connected to Dynamics
365 for Sales as the live data source, you would have to make any corrections to the
data in Dynamics 365 for Sales.

After those changes are made, you can take advantage of the scheduled data refresh
capabilities to update the dataset that is stored in Power BI so that the revised data is
reflected in the dependent Power BI assets. To help comply with GDPR requirements,



you should have policies in place to ensure that you're refreshing your data at an
appropriate cadence.

Making changes to content in Viva Engage
For messages, a user can edit a given message to rectify any inaccuracies. They can
request a list of all their messages from a Viva Engage verified admin, and then select a
link in the file to review each message.

For files, a user can edit a given file to rectify any inaccuracies. They can request a list of
all the files they posted from a Viva Engage verified admin, and then access the files in
Viva Engage. Files that are exported into the Files folder can be viewed by searching for
the file by number. For example, for a file named 12345678.ppx in the export, use the
Search box in Viva Engage to search for 1235678.ppx. Or, go to https://www.viva-
engage.com/<network_name>/#/files/<file_number>; for example, https://www.viva-
engage.com/contosomkt.onmicrosoft.com/#/files/12345678.

For data that the user can access through their profile and settings, the user can make
any needed changes.

The user's profile:
If the user has a Viva Engage identity, the user has full control of their profile.
For information on how to view and modify the profile, see Change my Viva
Engage profile and settings .
If the user has an Office 365 identity, the Viva Engage user profile is pulled
automatically from Office 365, which gets the profile information from Microsoft
Entra ID. Viva Engage users can temporarily change their profiles in Viva
Engage, but these changes are overwritten when there's a change in Microsoft
Entra ID, so the best place to view and change directory data is Microsoft Entra
ID. The user needs to request that Microsoft Entra ID be updated. See Manage
Viva Engage users across their lifecycle from Office 365 and Add or change
profile information for a user in Microsoft Entra ID.

The user's settings:
The user can change their own settings. For information on how to view and
modify user settings, see Change my Viva Engage profile and settings .
The user's group membership, bookmarked messages, followed users, and
followed articles. The user can change this information; see Tips for staying
organized in Viva Engage .

Responding to DSR restriction requests



Here are the ways to restrict the processing of data in Office 365:

Remove an Office 365 application license to prevent users from accessing data via
an application
Prevent users from accessing their OneDrive for work and school account
Turn off an Office 365 service from processing the data
Temporarily remove the data from SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school
and retain it on-premises
Temporarily restrict all access to a SharePoint site
Prevent a user from signing in to Office 365

If your organization determines later that a restriction no longer applies, you can end
the restriction by reversing the steps you took to restrict it; such as reassigning licenses,
turning a service back on, or allowing a user to sign in to Office 365.

Removing the license for an Office 365 application
As previously explained, licenses for all Office 365 applications that are included in your
organization's Microsoft 365 for business subscription are assigned to all users by
default. If necessary to restrict, access to data that's subject to a DSR, an IT admin can
use the Office 365 admin portal temporarily turn-off a user's license for an application. If
a user then tries to use that application, they'll receive an unlicensed product
notification or a message saying they no longer have access. For details, see Remove
licenses from users in Office 365 for business.

Notes:

To restrict a user from accessing Viva Engage, you must first enforce Office 365
identify for a Viva Engage user and then remove the user's Viva Engage license.

For scenarios that take advantage of Power BI Embedded, you can restrict access
to the independent software vendor (ISV) application that the content is
embedded in.

Preventing users from accessing their OneDrive for work
and school account
Removing a user's SharePoint license won't prevent them from accessing their OneDrive
for work and school account if it exists. You have to remove the user's permissions to
their OneDrive for work and school account to. You can do this by removing the user as
a site collection owner of their OneDrive for work and school account. Specifically, you
have to remove the user from the Primary Site Collection Administrator and Site



Collection Administrators groups in their user profile. See the "Add and remove admins
on a OneDrive for work and school account" section in Manage user profiles in the
SharePoint admin center.

Turning off an Office 365 Service
Another way to address a DSR request to restrict the processing of data is to turn off an
Office 365 service. This impacts all users in your entire organization and prevents
everyone from using the service or accessing data in the service.

The most expedient way to turn off a service is to use Office 365 PowerShell and remove
the corresponding user license from all users in the organization. This will in effect
restrict anyone from access data in that service. For detailed instructions, see Disable
access to services with Office 365 PowerShell and follow the procedures to disable
Office 365 services for users from a single licensing plan.

７ Note

For Viva Engage, in additional to removing the Viva Engage license from user
accounts, you also must disable users' ability to sign in to Viva Engage with Viva
Engage credentials (by enforcing the use of their Office 365 credentials when
signing in). For detailed instructions, see Turn off Viva Engage access for Microsoft
365 users .

Temporarily removing data from SharePoint or OneDrive
for work and school sites
Another way to restrict the processing of personal data is to temporarily remove it from
Office 365 in response to a DSR. When your organization determines that the restriction
no longer applies, you can import the data back into Office 365.

Because most Office documents are on a SharePoint or OneDrive for work and school
site, here's a high-level process for removing documents from sites and then
reimporting them.

1. Get a copy of the document that is the subject of the restriction request. You may
have to request either access to the site or ask your organization's admin or a site
collection administrator to provide you with a copy of the document.

2. Store the document in an on-premises location (such as a file server or a file share)
or another location other than your Office 365 tenant in the Microsoft cloud.



3. Permanently delete (purge) the original document from Office 365. This is a 3-step
process:

a. Delete the original copy of the document. When you delete a document from a
site, it's sent to the site Recycle Bin (also called the first-stage Recycle Bin).

b. Go to the site Recycle Bin and delete that copy of the document. When you
delete a document from the site Recycle Bin, it's sent to the site collection
Recycle Bin (also called the second-stage Recycle Bin). See Delete a file, folder, or
link from a SharePoint document library .

c. Go to the site collection Recycle Bin and delete that copy of the document,
which permanently removes it from Office 365. See Delete items from the site
collection recycle bin .

4. When the restriction no longer applies, the copy of the document that was stored
on-premises can be reuploaded to the site in Office 365.

） Important

The preceding procedure won't work if the document is located on a site that is on
hold (with one of the retention or legal hold features in Office 365). In the case
where a restriction request for a DSR takes precedence over a legal hold, the hold
would have to be removed from the site before a document could be permanently
deleted. Additionally, the document history for deleted documents is permanently
removed.

Temporarily restricting access to SharePoint sites
A SharePoint administrator can temporarily prevent all users from accessing a
SharePoint site collection by locking the site collection (by using the Set-SPOSite -
LockState command in SharePoint PowerShell). This prevents users for accessing the site
collection and any content or data that's located in the site. If you then determine that
users should be able to access the site, the administrator can unlock the site. See Set-
SPOSite for information about running this PowerShell cmdlet.

Preventing a user from signing in to Office 365
An IT admin can also prevent a user from signing into Office 365, which would prevent
the user from accessing any Office 365 online service or processing any data stored in
Office 365. See Block a former employee's access to Office 365 data.



Part 2: Responding to DSRs with Respect to
Insights Generated by Office 365
The Microsoft suite of Office 365 services includes online services that provide insights
to users and organizations that have opted to use them.

Viva Personal Insights provide insights to individual users
Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights provides insights to organizations.

These services are described in the following section:

Viva Personal Insights
Viva Personal Insights provides statistics to users to help them understand how they
spend their time at work. To help your users better understand the data that is
presented to them in their personal dashboard and how that data is calculated, direct
your users to Viva Personal Insights dashboard.

Access and export
If your organization uses Viva Personal Insights, then Microsoft generates insights for all
users. Viva Personal Insights are derived from email and meeting headers in the user's
mailbox. Users can go to the Viva Personal Insights dashboard while signed in to their
Office 365 account to view the insights that are generated about how they spend their
time at work. They can take screenshots of Viva Personal Insights if they want to have
permanent copies of their information.

Rectify
All insights generated by Viva Personal Insights are derived from the user's mail and
calendar items. Therefore, there's nothing to rectify other than the source email or
calendar items.

Restrict
To restrict processing for a specific user, you can opt them out of Viva Personal Insights.
To see how, see Configure Viva Personal Insights.

Delete



All mailbox content, including Viva Personal Insights data, is purged when a user
account is "hard-deleted" from Active Directory. For more information, see the Deleting
a user section in this guide.

Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights
Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights allows organizations to augment Office 365
data with their own business data to gain insights about organizational productivity,
collaboration patterns, and employee engagement. This article explains the control that
your organization has over the data that Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights
processes and who has access to that data.

To assist you with DSRs in Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights:

1. Determine whether your organization is using Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced
Insights. For more information, see Assign licenses to users. If your organization
isn't using Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights, there's no further action.

2. If your organization is using Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights, then see
who in your organization has been assigned to the role of Viva
Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights administrator. You should also determine if the
data subject's mailbox is licensed for Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights. If
necessary, have your Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights administrator
contact Microsoft Support in handling the following DSR requests:

Access and export
Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights reports created by you may or may not contain
personal data of users that your organization licensed for Viva
Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights, depending on the information that your
organization used to supplement the Office 365 data. Your Viva
Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights administrator needs to review those reports to
determine if they contain a user's personal data. If a report does contain a user's
personal data, then you need to decide if you want to provide a copy of that report to
the user. Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights allows you to export the report.

Rectify
As explained above, Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights uses Office 365 data with
the organizational data that you provide to generate reports of interest to you. The
Office 365 data can't be rectified; it's based on a user's email and calendar activities.



However, the organizational data that you've uploaded into Viva
Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights to generate the report can be rectified. To do this,
you need to correct the source data, upload it, and rerun the report to generate a new
Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights report.

Restrict
To restrict processing for a specific user, you can remove their Viva
Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights license.

Delete
If a data subject would like to be removed from a Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced
Insights report or set of reports, you can delete the report. It is your responsibility to
delete users from any organizational data that you used to generate the report, and
reupload the data. All data about the user is removed when a user account is "hard-
deleted" from Microsoft Entra ID.

To remove the personal data of a data subject, an administrator can take the following
steps:

1. Remove the Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights license from the data subject.
2. Delete the Microsoft Entra entry for the data subject. (For more information, see

Delete a user.)
3. Contact support and have support open a ticket for a Data Subject Rights (DSR)

user-delete request. In this ticket, identify the data subject by using their User
Principal Name (UPN).

4. Export a copy of the HR data from the company's HR system (see Export data),
remove the data subject's information from that HR data file, and then upload the
edited HR data file in .csv format into Viva Manager/Leader/Advanced Insights (see
Upload organizational data).

Part 3: Responding to DSRs for system-
generated Logs
Microsoft also provides you with the ability to access, export, and delete system-
generated logs that may be deemed personal under the GDPR's broad definition of
"personal data." Examples of system-generated logs that may be deemed personal
under GDPR include:

Product and service usage data such as user activity logs



User search requests and query data
Data generated, processed, and stored by product and services as a product of
system functionality and interaction by users or other systems

The ability to restrict or rectify data in system-generated logs isn't supported. Data in
system-generated logs constitutes factual actions conducted within the Microsoft cloud
and diagnostic data, and modifications to such data would compromise the historical
record of actions and increase fraud and security risks.

Accessing and exporting system-generated logs using the
Azure portal
Microsoft provides you with the ability to access and export Customer Data for
Microsoft 365 applications. The tenant admin is the only person within your
organization who can access system-generated logs associated with a particular user's
use of Microsoft 365 products and services.

The data retrieved for an export request is provided in a machine-readable format and
in files that allow the user to know which services the data is associated with. The data
retrieved won't include data that may compromise the security or stability of the service.
This process is designed to protect potentially sensitive information by requiring an
admin to authenticate and download the data directly. This export package is stored by
Microsoft for up to 30 days, at which point it's removed. Admins must download that
data within the 30-day period, or a new export request is required to regenerate the
package. Instructions on downloading the package is generated by the export process
and is available in the Azure blob created or specified during the initial export request. 

In order to complete the export of Customer Data, the Microsoft 365 Exchange
Online setting must be enabled. The tenant admin is the only person within your
organization who can access and export customer data. 

To access and export system-generated logs:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal. 

2. Type “User Privacy” in the search box. 

3. Select User Privacy. 

4. Under section Request to export user data, select Add export request. 

5. Complete the Export data request: 



User Type: Type the email address of the Microsoft Entra user that requested
the export and search by name or email the Microsoft Entra user that
requested the export. 
Export destination: Select the storage container to store the exported
logs/data. 

6. Select Create.

7. The export request goes into Pending status. You can view the report status on the
User privacy > Manage User Requests.

Within the export, the tenant admin receives instructions with additional steps
to complete the data export process. 

） Important

Because personal data can come from multiple systems, it's possible that the export
process might take up to 30 days to complete.

Notify about exporting or deleting issues
If you run into issues while exporting or deleting data from the Azure portal, go to the
Azure portal Help + Support blade and submit a new ticket under Subscription
Management > Privacy and compliance requests for Subscriptions > Privacy Blade
and GDPR Requests.

７ Note

When you export data from the Azure portal, system-generated data for a few
applications will not be exported. To export data for these applications, see
Additional steps to export system-generated log data.

The following summarizes accessing and exporting system-generated logs:

How long does an export request using the Azure portal take to complete a
request?: This can depend on several factors. Usually it should complete in one or
two days, but it can take up to 30 days.

What format will the output be in?: The output is structured machine-readable
files such as XML, CSV, or JSON.



Who has access to Azure portal to submit access requests for system-generated
data?: Microsoft 365 tenant administrators have access to the Azure portal.

What data do the export results return?: The results contain system-generated
logs that Microsoft stores. Exported data spans across various Microsoft services
including Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics. The results don't include data that may
compromise the security or stability of the service.

How is data returned to the user?: Data is exported to your organization's Azure
storage location; it's up to admins in your organization to determine how they'll
show/return this data to users.

What will system-generated log data look like?: Below is an example, the data are
in JSON format:

JSON

[{
"DateTime": "2017-04-28T12:09:29-07:00",
"AppName": "SharePoint",
"Action": "OpenFile",
"IP": "154.192.13.131",
"DevicePlatform": "Windows 1.0.1607"
}]

Product and service usage data for some of Microsoft's most often-used services, such
as Exchange Online, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Yammer, and Office 365 Groups can
also be retrieved by searching the Office 365 audit log in the Microsoft Purview
compliance portal. For more information, see Use the Office 365 audit log search tool in
DSR investigations in Appendix A. Using the audit log may be of interest to you because
it's possible to assign permissions to other people in your organization (such as your
compliance officer) to search the audit log to access this data.

Deleting system-generated logs
To delete system-generated logs retrieved through an access request, you must remove
the user from the service and permanently delete their Microsoft Entra account. For
instructions about permanently delete a user, see the Deleting a user section in this
guide. It's important to note that permanently deleting a user account is irreversible
once initiated.

Permanently deleting a user account removes the user's data from system-generated
logs, except for data that may compromise the security or stability of the service, for
nearly all Office 365 services within 30 days.



One exception to this 30-day period is that the permanent deletion of the user account
in Exchange Online takes longer than 30 days. This is due to the critical nature of
Exchange Online content and to prevent accidental data loss. Exchange Online has been
engineered to intentionally place data in a holding state for up to 60 days after a user
account has been permanently deleted. To permanently delete a user's Exchange Online
data in a 30-day time frame, permanently delete the user account in Microsoft Entra ID
and then contact Microsoft Support  and request that the user's Exchange Online data
be manually removed outside the scheduled delete process. For more information, see
Removing Exchange Online data, which was previously explained in this guide

Deleting a user's account won't remove system-generated logs for Viva Engage. To
remove the data from these applications, see one of the following:

Viva Engage - Manage GDPR data subject requests in Viva Engage

National clouds
A global IT admin needs to do the following to export system-generated log data in the
following national clouds:

Office 365 US Government: Go to the Office 365 admin portal  and submit a
request to Microsoft Support.
Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China): Go to the Office 365 operated by
21Vianet admin portal  and then go to Commerce > Subscription > Privacy >
GDPR and enter the required information.

Part 4: Additional resources to assist you with
DSRs

DSR guides for other Microsoft enterprise services
This guide is dedicated to the article of how to find and act on personal data to respond
to DSRs when using Office 365 products, services, and administrative tools. Go to the
Microsoft Service Trust Portal  to access similar guides for other Microsoft enterprise
services.

Microsoft Support
Support data is the data you and your users provide to Microsoft if your organization or
your users engage with Microsoft to receive product support related to Office 365 or



other Microsoft products and services (for example, to troubleshoot unexpected product
behavior). Some of this data may contain personal data. For more information, see
Microsoft Support and Professional Services Data Subject Requests for the GDPR.

Product and services authenticated with an Org ID for
which Microsoft is a data controller
Parts 1 through 3 of this guide covers products and services for which Microsoft is a
data processor to your organization, and thus DSR capability is made available to your
tenant administrator. There are various circumstances where your organization's users
may use their work or school account (also referred to as Microsoft Entra ID) to sign in
to Microsoft products and services for which Microsoft is a data controller. For all such
products and services, your users need to initiate their own data subject requests
directly to Microsoft using privacy response center portal  and Microsoft will fulfill the
requests directly to the user. By design, products and services involving storage of user-
authored content enable users to access, export, rectify, and delete their user-authored
content as part of the inherent functionality of the products. Scenarios where this may
apply include the following:

Optional connected online services: Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise makes
certain optional connected online services available to the user. The list of services
and related user controls are listed here . You can decide whether you would like
to allow your end users to use these services. For more information, see How
admins can manage controller services in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. If
these optional services process personal data, Microsoft is a data controller for
these services. Required service data collected through these optional connected
experiences is available through Data Subject Requests (DSRs).
User feedback: If your users elect to provide feedback on Microsoft products and
services, Microsoft is a data controller for such feedback to the extent it contains
personal data. Microsoft fulfills any data subject requests for feedback collected by
Microsoft (including feedback managed by Microsoft subprocessors) except in
cases where Microsoft has instructed users not to include personal data during the
feedback collection process. Exceptions: If Microsoft has instructed users not to
include personal data during the feedback collection process, Microsoft relies on
that instruction and will assume that no personal data has been provided. Users
who have created a separate account with third-party feedback service providers
need to fulfill their DSR directly with those providers.
Windows authenticated via work or school account: If your organization has
purchased Windows licenses, and your users authenticate to organization-
provided Windows with their work or school account, Microsoft acts as a data
controller.



User-acquired products or services: If you allow your users, acting in their
individual capacity, to acquire Microsoft products or services that use Microsoft
Entra ID for authentication (for example, Office add-ons or applications available in
a Microsoft Store), Microsoft may be a data controller. For any such Microsoft
products or services, users need to contact Microsoft directly to initiate a DSR.

） Important

If you delete a user as enabled via Microsoft Entra ID, your (former) user will lose
the ability to sign in to any products or services for which he or she formerly relied
upon for a work or school account. Additionally, Microsoft will no longer be able to
authenticate the user in connection with a DSR request for products or services for
which Microsoft is a data controller. If you wish to enable a user to initiate DSRs
against such services, it is important you instruct your user to do so before you
delete the user's Microsoft Entra account.

Personal accounts
If your users have used Microsoft accounts (that is, personal accounts) to acquire
products and services from Microsoft for their own use and for which Microsoft is a data
controller, they may initiate DSR requests by using the Microsoft privacy dashboard .

Third-party products
If your organization, or your users acting in their individual capacity, have acquired
products or services from third parties and use their Microsoft work or school account
for authentication, any data subject requests should be directed to the applicable third
party.

Appendix A: Preparing for DSR investigations
To help prepare your organization to undertake DSR investigations using Office 365
services, consider the following recommendations:

Use the DSR eDiscovery case tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to
manage DSR investigations
Set up Compliance Boundaries to limit the scope of Content Searches
Use the audit log search tool in DSR investigations



Use the DSR case tool to manage DSR investigations
We recommend that you use the DSR case tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance
portal to manage DSR investigations. By using the DSR case tool, you can:

Create a separate case for each DSR investigation.

Use the built-in to search for all content related to a specific data subject. When
you create a case and start the search, these content locations are searched:

All mailboxes in your organization (including the mailboxes associated with all
Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups)
All SharePoint sites and OneDrive for work and school accounts in your
organization
All Microsoft Teams sites and Microsoft 365 group sites in your organization
All public folders in Exchange Online

Revise the default search query and rerun the search to narrow the search results.

Control who has access to the case by adding people as members of the case; only
members can access the case and are only able to see their cases in the list of
cases on the DSR cases page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
Additionally, you can assign different permissions to different members of the
same case. For example, you could allow some members to only view the case and
the results of a Content Search and allow other members to create searches and
export search results.

Create export jobs to export the search results in response to a DSR export
request. You can export all content returned by the Content Search. Other Office
365 data related to a data subject is also exported.

Create export jobs to export the search results in response to a DSR export
request. You can export all content returned by the Content Search. You can also
export system-generated logs for Office Roaming service.

Delete cases when the DSR investigation process is complete. This removes all the
content searches and export jobs associated with the case.

To get started with using DSR cases, see Manage GDPR data subject requests with the
DSR case tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

） Important

An eDiscovery Administrator can view and manage all DSR cases in your
organization. For more information about the different roles related to eDiscovery,



see Assign eDiscovery permissions to potential case members.

Set up Compliance Boundaries to limit the scope of
Content Searches
Compliance Boundaries are implemented by using the search permissions filtering
functionality in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Compliance Boundaries create
logical search boundaries within an organization that control/limit which content
locations (for example Exchange Online mailboxes and SharePoint sites) that an IT
admin or compliance officer can search. Compliance Boundaries are useful for multi-
national organizations that need to respect geographical boundaries, governmental
organizations that need to separate different agencies, and business organizations that
segregated into business unit or department. For all these scenarios, Compliance
Boundaries can be used in DSR investigations to limit which mailboxes and sites can be
searched by people involved in the investigation.

You can use Compliance Boundaries together with eDiscovery cases to limit the content
locations that can be searched in an investigation to those locations only within the
agency or business unit.

Here's a high-level overview of how to implement Compliance Boundaries (together
with eDiscovery cases) for DSR investigations.

1. Determine the agencies in your organization that will be designated as a
compliance boundary.

2. Determine which user object attribute in Microsoft Entra ID will be used to define
the compliance boundary. For example, you might choose the Country,
CountryCode, or Department attribute, so that members of the admin role group
that you create in the next step can only search the content locations of the users
that have a specific value for that attribute. This is how you limit who can search
for content in a specific agency.

７ Note

Currently, you must perform an additional step for OneDrive for work and
school and file a Microsoft Support request to have the attribute synchronized
to OneDrive for work and school accounts.

3. Create an admin role group in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal for each
compliance boundary. We recommend that you create these role groups by



copying the built-in eDiscovery Manager role group and then removing any roles
as necessary.

4. Add members to each of the specific role groups as eDiscovery Mangers. Members
are the people responsible for investigating and responding to DSRs, and will
typically consist of IT admins, data privacy officers, compliance managers, and
human resource representatives.

5. Create a search permissions filter for each compliance boundary so that the
members of the corresponding admin role group can only search mailboxes and
sites for users within that agency/compliance boundary. The search permissions
filter allows members of the corresponding role group to search only the content
locations with user object attribute value that corresponds to the
agency/compliance boundary.

For step-by-step instructions, see Set up compliance boundaries for eDiscovery
investigations in Office 365.

Use the audit log search tool in DSR investigations
IT admins can use the audit log search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
to identity documents, files, and other Office 365 resources that users have created,
accessed, changed, or deleted. Searching for this kind of activity can be useful in DSR
investigations. For example, in SharePoint and OneDrive for work and school, auditing
events are logged when users perform these activities:

Accessed a file
Modified a file
Moved a file
Uploaded or downloaded a file

You can search the audit log for specific activities, types of activities, activities performed
by a specific user, and other search criteria. In addition to SharePoint and OneDrive for
work and school activities, you can also search for activities in Flow, Power BI, and
Microsoft Teams. Auditing records are retained for 90 days. Therefore, you won't be able
to search for user activities that occurred more than 90 days ago. For a complete list of
audited activities and how to search the audit log, see Search the audit log in the
Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

 Tip



To work around the 90-day limitation discussed above and maintain a running
history of your organization's auditing records, you could export all activities on a
recurring schedule (for example, every 30 days) to have a continuous record of your
organization's auditing records.

Visual Studio Family Data Subject
Requests for the GDPR and CCPA
Article • 03/07/2025

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to
people (known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage their personal data.
Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their
personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of personal data, requesting
corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an
electronic format. A formal request by a data subject to a data controller (an employer
or other type of agency or organization that has control over personal data) to take an
action on that data subject's personal data is called a data subject request or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and
obligations to California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject
Rights, such as the right to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal
information. The CCPA also provides for certain disclosures, protections against
discrimination when electing exercise rights, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for
certain data transfers classified as "sales". This document guides you to information on
the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR and CCPA using
Microsoft products and services.

For general information about GDPR, see the GDPR section of the Service Trust portal .

Products covered by this guide
This guide discusses how to use Microsoft tools to export or delete personal data
collected during authenticated (signed-in) session usage of Visual Studio and Visual
Studio for Mac (through December 2024), as well as for Microsoft extensions for these
products. This guide also covers how to make data subject requests for personal data
collected when using Visual Studio Developer Community, NuGet.org, and the ASP.NET
website. These products may enable the use of non-Microsoft tools and extensions, and
Microsoft is not a data processor or controller for these tools and extensions. Users
should contact the tool or extension provider to understand the personal data and
collection policies for these tools and extensions.

For Azure DevOps, see Azure DevOps Services Data Subject Requests for the
GDPR.
For Visual Studio Code, see GDPR and VS Code .



Additional privacy information
The Microsoft Software License Terms accompanying the products, the Microsoft Privacy
Statement , and Microsoft's GDPR Commitments describe our data processing
practices.

Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac

Personal data we collect
As a data processor under the GDPR, Microsoft collects the data we need from users to
provide experiences for and improve Visual Studio and Microsoft extensions for Visual
Studio. (We also collect telemetry data for Visual Studio for Mac through December
2025.) There are two categories of data: customer data and system-generated logs.
Customer data includes user-identifiable transactional and interactional data that these
products need to perform the service they provide. For example, to provide users with
personalized experiences such as roaming settings, we need to collect user account
information and settings data. System-generated logs are usage or diagnostic data that
are used to help identify and troubleshoot problems and improve our products and
services, and may also contain identifiable information about end users, such as a user
name. System-generated logs are retained for no more than 18 months. As an example,
system-generated logs are aggregated for each day of product usage and include the
usage date, the product used (for example, "Visual Studio 2022"), the action you took
(for example, "vs/core/packagecostsummary/solutionload"), and the number of times
the action was taken, as shown in this sample:

Log

{Time":"2/23/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 
2017","Action":"vs/core/packagecostsummary/solutionload","Target":"1 times",
"DevicePlatform":"Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}

{Time":"2/23/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 
2017","Action":"vs/ide/connected/accountmanagement/account","Target":"1 
times",
"DevicePlatform": "Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}

{"Time":"2/27/2018 12:00:00 AM","AppName":"Visual Studio 
2017","Action":"vs/core/perf/satellitepagefileusage","Target":"23 times",
"DevicePlatform":"Windows 10 Enterprise","IP":null,"InputMethod":null,
"SearchTerm":null,"SearchResult":null}



For more information, see System-generated logs collected by Visual Studio.

Only personal data that is attached to authenticated identities can be serviced by a DSR.
So, for example, because Visual Studio Code does not support sign-in, system-
generated logs from it are not attached to an authenticated identity and cannot be
serviced. For more information, see GDPR and Visual Studio Code . In general, we do
not store data for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier; however, certain extensions and
components may provide data attached to authenticated identities and can be serviced
by a DSR as outlined below.

How users can control personal data
Visual Studio 2015 and later, Visual Studio for Mac, and Visual Studio Code provide the
following means for your users to stop data collection. In addition, Visual Studio and
Visual Studio for Mac allow you as controller to export, or delete data that has already
been gathered.

In-app settings
Users can control the privacy settings for these products. For more information, see the
following

How to manage privacy settings in Visual Studio.
How to manage privacy settings in Visual Studio for Mac.
How to disable telemetry reporting in Visual Studio Code .

Exporting or deleting data
Controllers can manage customer data and system-generated logs collected from their
data subjects by one of two methods, depending upon how their Visual Studio Family
product or Microsoft extensions were registered. In some cases, both methods must be
used. Both methods allow Controllers to download a copy of their activity history
managed by that method. Closure of an AAD or MSA account deletes associated Visual
Studio customer data, and anonymizes personally identifiable data in system-generated
logs pertaining to these products. Anonymized system-generated logs are retained for
no more than 18 months.

Users that have registered a Visual Studio Family product (excluding VS Code) by
using an account that is backed by an Azure tenant, for example, AAD account or
MSA account associated with an Azure subscription, can follow the instructions in
Azure Data Subject Requests for the GDPR.



Users that have registered a Visual Studio Family product (excluding VS Code)
without an account that is backed by an Azure tenant, for example many accounts
using a Microsoft Account (MSA), can use the web-based Microsoft Privacy
Response Center  available through their Microsoft account to view, control, and
delete activity data tied to their Microsoft account across multiple Microsoft
services. In this scenario, the user is a controller for their own personal data.

７ Note

When an MSA account holder deletes their account, all their personally identifiable
data pertaining to these products is deleted, whether the account is backed by an
Azure tenant or not, and system-generated logs are anonymized.

For Visual Studio 2013, the data we collect is anonymized. For Visual Studio 2012 and
prior releases, we immediately delete the data upon receipt. In both cases, there is
nothing to view, export, or delete at a later time.

Visual Studio Developer Community
We support General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  requests through the
Developer Community  website. You can View, Export, or Delete your feedback data.
For more information, see Developer Community GDPR Data Subject Request
processing.

NuGet
For more information on DSR for NuGet.org, see NuGet User Data Requests.

ASP.NET
For information on DSR for the ASP.NET website, see The ASP.NET Website and GDPR
Data Subject Request processing .

IIS.NET
For information on DSR for the IIS.NET website, see The IIS.NET Website and GDPR Data
Subject Request processing .

Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration Data Subject Requests for
the GDPR and CCPA
08/21/2025

Applies to:

Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, and Education edition version 1809 with July 2021 update
and later
Windows 11 Enterprise, Pro, and Education edition

Introduction to Data Subject Requests (DSRs)
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives rights to people (known in the
regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that an employer or other type of
agency or organization (known as the data controller or just controller) collects. Personal data is
defined broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural
person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data. These rights include
obtaining copies of personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it,
deleting it, or receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A
formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is
called a Data Subject Request or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides privacy rights and obligations to
California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject Rights, such as the right
to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal information. The CCPA also provides
for certain disclosures, protections against discrimination when electing exercise rights, and
"opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for certain data transfers classified as "sales." This document
guides you to information on the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR
and CCPA using Microsoft products and services.

This guide discusses how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to help
our controller customers find and act on personal data to respond to DSRs. Specifically, this
guide includes how to find, access, and act on personal data in the Windows diagnostic data
collected by Microsoft when the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration is enabled.
Here's a quick overview of the processes outlined in this guide:

1. Access: Retrieve Windows diagnostic data associated with a data subject and if requested,
make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.

2. Delete: Permanently remove Windows diagnostic data associated with a data subject.



3. Export: Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable format) of Windows diagnostic
data to the data subject.

Each section in this guide outlines the technical procedures that a data controller organization
can take to respond to a DSR for Windows diagnostic data collected by Microsoft when the
Windows diagnostic data processor configuration is enabled.

Terminology
The following list provides definitions of terms that are relevant to this guide.

Controller—The natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that,
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal
data. Union or Member State law might determine the controller or specific criteria for its
nomination when it comes to the purposes and means of processing.

Personal data and data subject—Any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person ('data subject'). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors
specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social
identity of that natural person.

Processor—A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

Customer Data—All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and software,
that Microsoft receives from, or on behalf of, a customer through use of the enterprise
service.

Windows diagnostic data—Technical data from Windows devices about the device and
how Windows and related software are performing. Microsoft uses this data to keep
Windows up to date, secure, reliable, performant, and to make product improvements.
Some examples of Windows diagnostic data are the type of hardware you're using,
applications installed with their respective usage, and reliability information on device
drivers. Some Windows components and apps connect to Microsoft services directly, but
the data they exchange isn't Windows diagnostic data. For example, exchanging a user's
location for local weather or news isn't an example of Windows diagnostic data.

How to use this guide



When you enable the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, you become the
controller of the Windows diagnostic data collected from devices. For more information on this
configuration, see Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization.

Windows diagnostic data
Microsoft provides you with the ability to access, delete, and export Windows diagnostic data
associated with a user's use of the devices enabled with the Windows diagnostic data
processor configuration.

） Important

Some Windows diagnostic data is only associated with a device identifier and isn't
associated with a specific user. This type of device-level data isn't exported and is deleted
from our systems within 30 days.

The ability to rectify Windows diagnostic data isn't supported. Windows diagnostic data
constitutes factual actions conducted within Windows, and modifications to such data
would compromise the historical record of actions, increasing security risks and harming
reliability.

The next section provides steps on how to execute a data subject request for Windows
diagnostic data that is associated with a Microsoft Entra user ID. For more information, see
Windows 10 & Windows 11 Privacy Compliance: A Guide for IT and Compliance Professionals.

Executing DSRs against Windows diagnostic data
Microsoft provides the ability to access, delete, and export certain Windows diagnostic data
through the Azure portal and directly via preexisting application programming interfaces
(APIs).

Step 1: Access
Microsoft provides a way for the tenant administrator within your organization to access
Windows diagnostic data associated with a particular user's use of a device enabled with the
Windows diagnostic data processor configuration. The data retrieved for an access request
comes in a machine-readable format and comes in files that let the user know which devices
and services the data is associated with. As noted previously, the data retrieved doesn't include
data that might compromise the security or stability of the Windows device.



The Azure portal provides the enterprise customer's tenant administrator the capability to
manage DSR access requests. Azure DSR, Part 2, Step 3: Export describes how to execute a DSR
access request for Windows diagnostic data, via export, through the Azure portal.

Step 2: Delete
Microsoft provides a way to execute user-based DSR delete requests based on a particular
user's Microsoft Entra object.

For user-based delete requests, Microsoft offers two solutions. There's a portal experience
providing the enterprise customer's tenant administrator the capability to manage DSR delete
requests. Azure DSR, Part 1, Step 5: Delete, describes how to execute a DSR delete request for
Windows diagnostic data through the Azure portal by deleting a user and associated data.

Microsoft also provides the ability to delete users, which in turn deletes Windows diagnostic
data, directly via a preexisting application programming interface (API). Details are described in
the API reference documentation.

） Important

Deleting collected data doesn't stop further collection from the device. To turn off data
collection, follow the procedure described in the respective service's reference
documentation.

Step 3: Export
Only the tenant administrator within your organization can access Windows diagnostic data
associated with a particular user's use of a device enabled with the Windows diagnostic data
processor configuration. The data retrieved for an export request comes in a machine-readable
format and comes in files that let the user know which devices and services the data is
associated with. As noted previously, the data retrieved doesn't include data that could
compromise the security or stability of the Windows device. Azure DSR, Part 2, Step 3: Export
describes how to execute a DSR export request for Windows diagnostic data through the Azure
portal.

Microsoft also provides the ability to export Windows diagnostic data directly via a preexisting
application programming interface (API). Details are described in the API reference
documentation. Tenant administrators can use script automation to iterate through user IDs in
their tenancy and initiate export requests for each user. This method supports full tenancy
exports and works with processor-configured devices. Rate limits might be imposed by Azure



Data Store; reference the current guidance on scalability and rate limits. Storage fees  and
egress fees  might apply depending on the volume of data exported.

Notify us about exporting or deleting issues
If you encounter issues while exporting or deleting Windows diagnostic data from the Azure
portal, go to the Azure portal Help + Support blade and submit a new ticket under
Subscription Management > Privacy and compliance requests for Subscriptions > Privacy
Blade and GDPR Requests.

７ Note

A Windows diagnostic data export request can take up to five days to complete. If you
experience issues, wait at least seven days before opening a support ticket.



Windows 365 Data Subject Requests for
the GDPR and CCPA
06/09/2025

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  gives rights to people
(known in the regulation as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has been collected
by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the data controller or just
controller). Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an
identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their
personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of personal data, requesting corrections to
it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an electronic format so it can be
moved to another controller. A formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an
action on their personal data is called a Data Subject Request or DSR.

Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provides privacy rights and obligations to
California consumers, including rights similar to GDPR's Data Subject Rights, such as the right
to delete, access, and receive (portability) their personal information. The CCPA also provides
for certain disclosures, protections against discrimination when electing exercise rights, and
"opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for certain data transfers classified as "sales." This document
guides you to information on the completion of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) under the GDPR
and CCPA using Microsoft products and services.

The guide discusses how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to help
our controller customers find and act on personal data to respond to DSRs. Specifically, this
guidance includes how to find, access, and act on personal data or personal information that
reside in the Microsoft cloud. Here's a quick overview of the processes outlined in this guide:

Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that might be
the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected, you can
perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps to respond to
the request. Alternatively, you might determine that the request doesn't meet your
organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make
a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.
Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where
applicable.
Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various
Azure services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can also remove
data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another location.
Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resided in the Microsoft cloud.



Export/Receive (Portability): Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable format)
of personal data or personal information to the data subject.

Each section in this guide outlines the technical procedures that a data controller organization
can take to respond to a DSR for personal data in the Microsoft cloud.

Terminology
The following list provides definitions of terms that are relevant to this guide.

Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by
Union or Member State law, the controller, or the specific criteria for its nomination may
be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that
natural person.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: All data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and software, that
are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, a customer through use of the enterprise
service. Customer Data includes both (1) identifiable information of end users (for
example, user names and contact information in Microsoft Entra ID) and Customer
Content that a customer uploads into or creates in specific services (for example,
customer content in an Azure Storage account, customer content of an Azure SQL
Database, or a customer's virtual machine image in Azure Virtual Machines).
System-Generated Logs: Logs and related data generated by Microsoft that help
Microsoft provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain primarily
pseudonymized data, such as unique identifiers—typically a number generated by the
system that cann't on its own identify an individual person but is used to deliver the
enterprise services to users. System-generated logs may also contain identifiable
information about end users, such as a user name.

How to use this guide
This guide consists of two parts:



Part 1: Responding to Data Subject Requests for Customer Data: Part 1 of this guide
discusses how to access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export data from applications in
which you have authored data. This section details how to execute DSRs against both
Customer Content and also identifiable information of end users.
Part 2: Responding to Data Subject Requests for System-Generated Logs: When you use
Microsoft's enterprise services, Microsoft generates some information, known as System-
Generated Logs, in order to provide the service. Part 2 of this guide discusses how to
access, delete, and export such information for Azure.

Understanding DSRs for Microsoft Entra ID and
Microsoft Windows 365
When you're considering services provided to enterprise customers, execution of DSRs must
always be understood within the context of a specific Microsoft Entra tenant. Notably, DSRs are
always executed within a given Microsoft Entra tenant. If a user is participating in multiple
tenants, it's important to emphasize that a given DSR is only executed within the context of the
specific tenant the request was received within. This context is critical to understand as it
means the execution of a DSR by one enterprise customer will not impact the data of an
adjacent enterprise customer.

The same also applies for Microsoft Windows 365 provided to an enterprise customer:
execution of a DSR against a Windows 365 account associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant will
only pertain to data within the tenant. In addition, it's important to understand the following
when handling Windows 365 accounts within a tenant:

If a Windows 365 user creates an Azure subscription, the subscription is handled as if it
were a Microsoft Entra tenant. Consequently, DSRs are scoped within the tenant as
described previously.
If an Azure subscription created via a Windows 365 account is deleted, it will not affect
the actual Windows 365 account. Again, as noted previously, DSRs executing within the
Azure subscription are limited to the scope of the tenant itself.

Part 1: DSR Guide for Customer Data

Executing DSRs against Customer Data
Microsoft provides the ability to access, delete, and export certain Customer Data through the
Azure portal and also directly via preexisting application programming interfaces (APIs) or user
interfaces (UIs) for specific services (also referred to as in-product experiences). Details



regarding such in-product experiences are described in the respective services' reference
documentation.

） Important

Services supporting in-product DSRs require direct usage of the service's application
programming interface (API) or user interface (UI), describing applicable CRUD (create,
read, update, delete) operations. Windows 365 can't fully support direct usage of
application programming interfaces (APIs) for DSRs, so requests must be submitted by
opening a support case (see instructions below). Consequently, execution of DSRs within a
given service must be done in addition to execution of a DSR within the Azure portal in
order to complete a full request for a given data subject. Please refer to specific services'
reference documentation for further details.

Step 1: Discover
The first step in responding to a DSR is to find the personal data that is the subject of the
request. This first step - finding and reviewing the personal data at issue - helps you determine
whether a DSR meets your organization's requirements for honoring or declining a DSR. For
example, after finding and reviewing the personal data at issue, you could determine the
request doesn't meet your organization's requirements because doing so might adversely
affect the rights and freedoms of others.

For Data Subject Requests specific to Windows 365 user data, tenant administrators need to
open a Microsoft support request to gain assistance with finding the personal data that is the
subject of the DSR. We recommend you follow the instructions related to your Windows 365
subscription level.

Windows 365 Business

Access to help and support is provided through the Microsoft Admin Center. To open a
support request for a DSR:

Select the Help icon in the Microsoft Admin Center banner or select Help & support on
the bottom right side of the Microsoft Admin Center page.
In the search field, type "Data Subject Request" or "DSR" and then select the Contact
Support button.
Complete the required information in the online service request and then select Contact
me.

For instructions on how to get help and open a support ticket, see Get support for Microsoft
365 for business. Support is included as part of your Windows 365 subscription.



Windows 365 Enterprise

Access to help and support is provided through Microsoft Endpoint Manager. To open a
support request for a DSR:

Go to Troubleshooting + support on another node in the admin center and select Help
and support to open a full screen experience of Help and support.
Select Windows 365.
In the search field, type "Data Subject Request" or "DSR" and then click the Contact
Support button.
Complete the required information in the online service request and then select Contact
me.

For instructions on how to get help and open a support ticket, see How to get support in
Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Support is included as part of your Windows 365 subscription.

Step 2: Access
After you find Customer Data containing personal data that is potentially responsive to a DSR,
it's up to you and your organization to decide which data to provide to the data subject. You
can provide them with a copy of the actual document, an appropriately redacted version, or a
screenshot of the portions you deem appropriate to share. For each of these responses to an
access request, you'll have to retrieve a copy of the document or other item that contains the
responsive data.

When providing a copy to the data subject, you might have to remove or redact personal
information about other data subjects and any confidential information.

Step 3: Rectify
If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your organization's
data, you and your organization have to determine whether it's appropriate to honor the
request. Rectifying the data could include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or
removing personal data from a document or other type or item.

As a data processor, Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to correct system-generated logs as it
reflects factual activities and constitutes a historical record of events within Microsoft services.
With respect to Windows 365, admins can't update device or app-specific information. If an
end user wants to correct any personal data (like the device name), they must do so directly on
their device. Such changes are synchronized the next time they connect to Windows 365.

Step 4: Restrict



Data subjects might request that you restrict processing of their personal data. We provide
both the Azure portal and preexisting application programming interfaces (APIs) or user
interfaces (UIs). These experiences provide the enterprise customer's tenant administrator the
capability to manage such DSRs through a combination of data export and data deletion.

Step 5: Delete
The "right to erasure" by the removal of personal data from an organization's Customer Data is
a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes removing all personal data and
system-generated logs, except audit log information. Windows 365 defaults to Microsoft
Endpoint Manager's standard practice to audit, export, or delete personal data.

Part 2: System-Generated Logs
Audit logs provide tenant admins with a record of activities that generate a change in
Microsoft Windows 365. Audit logs are available for many manage activities and typically
create, update (edit), delete, and assign actions. Remote tasks that generate audit events can
also be reviewed. These audit logs can contain personal data. Admins can't delete audit logs.
For details, see Audit personal data.

If you require assistance with running an audit log, follow the instructions outlined in Part 1
above.

Overview of system-generated logs from a
Data Subject Request (DSR) export
06/25/2025

The information in this article provides information about system-generated logs from a Data
Subject Request (DSR) export for Microsoft apps and services. For more information about
DSRs, see Data Subject Requests and the GDPR and CCPA.

What is a Data Subject Request (DSR)?
Regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) give individuals certain rights to manage their personal
data that has been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization. In these
regulations, individuals are referred to as “data subjects.” One of the rights given by these
regulations is the ability for data subjects to obtain a copy of the personal data that’s been
collected about them. A data subject can ask for a copy of that data through a Data Subject
Request (DSR).

What’s in a DSR export of system-generated logs?
When a tenant admin requests a DSR export of system-generated logs on behalf of a data
subject, the available data is exported to a location specified by the tenant admin. Usually the
export request is completed in a few days, but it can take up to 30 days.

The export contains one or more folders. Each folder of data is labeled with the name of the
product it originated from. Some folders may contain subfolders that have additional info
within them. The exported data can span across various Microsoft services, including Microsoft
365, Azure, and Dynamics 365.

The export contains various file types. Each file ends in an extension, which indicates how you
can open the file. For example, you can open a .json file in a browser or in a text editor.

The file named RequestInfo.json contains additional technical details related to the export.

What are system-generated logs?
Microsoft enterprise services, such as Microsoft 365, create system-generated logs as part of
the regular operation of their service. These logs continuously record system activity over time
to allow Microsoft to monitor whether systems are operating as expected. Microsoft provides



tenant administrators with the ability to perform a DSR to export specific system-generated
logs. Only tenant administrators can export system-generated logs. The following example
shows what information in a system-generated log export might look like in JSON format:

JSON

[{
   "DateTime": "2025-02-28T12:09:29-07:00",
   "AppName": "SharePoint",
   "Action": "OpenFile",
   "IP": " ",
   "DevicePlatform": "Windows"
}]  

Most system-generated logs data contain pseudonymous identifiers generated by Microsoft.
Although this data can't be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
information, some of it may be deemed personal under GDPR's definition for "personal data."
Examples of system-generated logs that may contain personal data include:

Product and service usage data such as user activity logs
Data specifically generated by the interaction of users with other systems

System-generated logs for specific products

365 apps and services (such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Microsoft 365 Copilot), see
Understanding Microsoft 365 diagnostic events in exported data.

GDPR Breach Notification
Article • 12/01/2024

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations
that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and
analyze data for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located.
Additional details can be found in the GDPR Summary topic. This document leads you to
information on the completion of Breach Notifications under the GDPR using Microsoft
products and services.

What constitute a breach of personal data
under the GDPR?
Personal data means any information related to an individual that can be used to
identify them directly or indirectly. A personal data breach is 'a breach of security
leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed'.

Terminology
Helpful definitions for GDPR terms used in this document:

Data Controller (Controller): A legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who
can be identified, directly or indirectly.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: Data produced and stored in the day-to-day operations of running
your business.

Microsoft and Breach Notification
Microsoft takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
seriously. A security incident/data breach refers to events such as unlawful access to
customer's data stored on Microsoft equipment or in Microsoft facilities, or



unauthorized access to such that has the potential to result in the loss, disclosure, or
alteration of customer data.

As a data processor, Microsoft ensures that service customers are able to meet the
GDPR's breach notification requirements as data controllers. Our notification provides
the information needed to make that assessment. Microsoft notifies customers of any
personal data breach, except for those cases where personal data is confirmed to be
unintelligible (for example, encrypted data where integrity of the keys is confirmed).

Data controllers are responsible for assessing risks to data privacy and determining
whether a breach requires notification of a customer's DPA. Microsoft provides the
information needed, along with your GDPR compliance policy, to make that assessment.

Initial notification includes a description of the nature of the breach, approximate user
impact, and mitigation steps (if applicable). If our investigation is not complete at the
time of initial notification, we will indicate next steps and timelines for subsequent
communication. For more information about how Microsoft detects and responds to a
breach of personal data, see Data Breach Notification Under the GDPR  in the Service
Trust Portal.

Details regarding breach notification for specific Microsoft products and services is
given below.

1. Office 365

Microsoft invests extensively in systems, processes, and personnel to reduce the
likelihood of personal data breach and to quickly detect and mitigate consequence
of breach if it does occur. Additional details can be read at Office 365 Investments
in Data Security.

A customer may become aware of a breach and wish to contact Microsoft. In this
case, notify Microsoft Support, which will then interface with engineering teams for
more information.

2. Azure and Dynamics 365

Microsoft has a global, 24x7 incident response service that works to mitigate the
effects of attacks against Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365.

Detection of Breaches: Since both Microsoft and the customer have security
obligations, Azure services employ a shared responsibility model to define
security and operational accountabilities. Microsoft does not monitor or
respond to security incidents within the customer's realm of responsibility.
Customer incident response may involve collaboration with Azure customer



support , given appropriate service contracts. Microsoft Azure also offers
various services (for example, Microsoft Defender for Cloud ) that customers
can utilize for developing and managing security incident response.

For a list of events that trigger a breach investigation in Microsoft Azure, see
Detection of Potential Breaches. Azure and Breach Notification under the
GDPR further details how Microsoft investigates, manages, and responds to
security incidents within Azure.

Data Breach Response: Microsoft determines appropriate priority and severity
levels of a breach by investigating the functional impact, recoverability, and
information impact of the incident. Priority and severity may change over the
course of the investigation, based on new findings and conclusions.
Microsoft's security response team works closely with global legal advisors to
help ensure that forensics are performed in accordance with legal obligations
and commitments to customers. These processes are detailed in Azure's Data
Breach Response.

Customer Notification: Microsoft Azure notifies customers and regulatory
authorities of data breaches as required. Customer notices are delivered in no
more than 72 hours from the time we declared a breach except for the
following circumstances:

Microsoft believes the act of performing a notification increases the risk to
other customers.
The 72-hour timeline may leave some incident details available. These
details will be provided to you as the investigation proceeds.

Further details can be found in Customer Notification.

3. Microsoft Support and Professional Services
The nature of professional services means that some data protection incidents may
fall within the customer's realm of responsibility. When Microsoft Professional
Services identifies a data protection incident, it follows documented industry
standard response plan as outlined in Scope & Limits of Data Protection Incident
Response Process.

4. Windows

The Windows diagnostic data processor configuration takes advantage of the
cloud service infrastructure and built-in security features to keep data safe.
Microsoft has a global, 24x7 incident response service that works to mitigate the
effects of attacks against Microsoft Azure and Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration.

Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and
Power Platform breach notification
under the GDPR
Article • 12/01/2024

Microsoft takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
seriously. Microsoft takes extensive security measures within its online services to
protect against data breaches. These measures include both physical and logical security
controls, as well as automated security processes, comprehensive information security
and privacy policies, and security and privacy training for all personnel.

Security is built into Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform from the
ground up, starting with the Security Development Lifecycle , a mandatory
development process that incorporates privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default
methodologies. The guiding principle of Microsoft's security strategy is to 'assume
breach,' which is an extension of the defense-in-depth strategy. By constantly
challenging the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power
Platform Microsoft can stay ahead of emerging threats. For more information on Azure
security, review these resources .

Microsoft has a dedicated global, 24x7 incident response service that works to mitigate
the effects of attacks against Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform.
Attested by multiple security and compliance audits (for example, ISO/IEC 27018),
Microsoft employs rigorous operations and processes at its data centers to prevent
unauthorized access, including 24x7 video monitoring, trained security personnel, smart
cards, and biometric controls.

Detection of potential breaches
Due to the nature of modern cloud computing, not all data breaches occurring in a
customer cloud environment involve Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, or Power Platform
services. Microsoft employs a shared responsibility model for Microsoft Azure, Dynamics
365, and Power Platform services to define security and operational accountabilities.
Shared responsibility is important when discussing security of a cloud service, because
both the cloud services provider and the customer are accountable for portions of cloud
security.

Microsoft doesn't monitor for or respond to security incidents within the customer's
realm of responsibility. A customer-only security compromise wouldn't be processed as



a Microsoft security incident and would require the customer tenant to manage the
response effort. Customer incident response may involve collaboration with Microsoft
Azure customer support , Dynamics 365 customer support and/or Power Platform
customer support, given appropriate service contracts. Microsoft also offers various
services (for example, Microsoft Defender for Cloud ) that customers can use for
developing and managing security incident response.

Microsoft responds to a potential data breach according to the security incident
response process, which is a subset of the Microsoft incident management plan.
Microsoft's Azure security incident response is implemented using a five-stage process:
Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, and Close. The Security Incident Response Team may
alternate between the diagnose and stabilize stages as the investigation progresses. An
overview of the security incident response process is below:

ﾉ Expand table

Stage Description

1: Detect First indication of a potential incident.

2: Assess An on-call incident response team member assesses the impact and severity of
the event. Based on evidence, the assessment may or may not result in further
escalation to the security response team.

3: Diagnose Security response experts conduct the technical or forensic investigation, identify
containment, mitigation, and work around strategies. If the security team believes
that customer data may have become exposed to an unlawful or unauthorized
individual, execution of the Customer Incident Notification process begins in
parallel.

4: Stabilize The incident response team creates a recovery plan to mitigate the issue. Crisis
and Recover containment steps such as quarantining impacted systems may occur immediately

and in parallel with diagnosis. Longer term mitigations may be planned which
occur after the immediate risk has passed.

5: Close and The incident response team creates a post-mortem that outlines the details of the
Post- incident, with the intention to revise policies, procedures, and processes to
mortem prevent a recurrence of the event.

The detection processes used by Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform
are designed to discover events that risk the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform services. Several events can trigger an
investigation:

Automated system alerts via internal monitoring and alerting frameworks. These
alerts could come in the way of signature-based alarms such as anti-malware,



intrusion detection or via algorithms designed to profile expected activity and alert
upon anomalies.
First party reports from Microsoft Services running on Microsoft Azure and Azure
Government.
Security vulnerabilities are reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center
(MSRC)  via Report an issue . MSRC works with partners and security
researchers around the world to help prevent security incidents and to advance
Microsoft product security.
Customer reports via portals including the Microsoft Azure Customer Support
Portal , Dynamics 365 customer support, Power Platform customer support,
Microsoft Azure portal , and Azure Government Management Portal , that
describe suspicious activity attributed to the Azure infrastructure (as opposed to
activity occurring within the customer's scope of responsibility).
Security Red Team and Blue Team  activity. This strategy uses a highly skilled Red
Team of offensive Microsoft security experts to uncover and attack potential
weaknesses in Microsoft Azure. The security response Blue Team must detect and
defend against the Red Team's activity. Both Red and Blue Team actions are used
to verify that Azure security response efforts are effectively managing security
incidents. Security Red Team and Blue Team activities are operated under rules of
engagement to help ensure the protection of customer data and personal data.
Escalations by operators of Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform
Services. Microsoft employees are trained to identify and escalate potential
security issues.

Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power
Platform data breach response
Microsoft assigns the investigation appropriate priority and severity levels by
determining the functional impact, recoverability, and information impact of the
incident. Both the priority and severity may change over the course of the investigation,
based on new findings and conclusions. Security events involving imminent or
confirmed risk to customer data are treated as high severity and worked around the
clock to resolution.

The Security Incident Response Team works with the applicable Microsoft service
engineers and subject matter experts to classify the event based on factual data from
the evidence. A security event may be classified as:

False Positive: An event that meets detection criteria but is found to be part of a
normal business practice and may need to be filtered out. Service teams identify



the root cause for false positives and will address them in a systematic way to fine-
tune them as needed.
Security Event: An observable occurrence in a system, service, and/or network for
attempted attack, circumvention of security controls, or an identified issue where
the facts indicate that Customer Data or Personal Data may have been lost,
destroyed, altered, disclosed, or accessed without authorization.
Security Incident/Customer Reportable Security/Privacy Incident (CRSPI): A
confirmed (for example, declared) breach of security leading to the accidental or
unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to
Customer Data or Personal Data while processed by Microsoft.
Privacy Event: A Security Event that affects Customer Data or Personal Data or data
processing that results in unintended consequences for privacy, including
noncompliance with Microsoft privacy policies, standards, and controls.
Privacy Incident/Customer Reportable Security/Privacy Incident (CRSPI): A
Security Incident that affects Customer Data or Personal Data, Data, or data
processing that results in unintended consequences for privacy, including
noncompliance with Microsoft privacy policies, standards, and controls.

For a CRSPI to be declared, Microsoft must determine that unauthorized access to
customer data has or has likely occurred and/or that there's a legal or contractual
commitment that notification must occur. An incident is generally declared a CRSPI after
the conclusion of the Diagnose stage of a security incident. However, the declaration
may happen at any point that all pertinent information is available.

Microsoft verifies that customer and business risk is successfully contained, and that
corrective measures are implemented. If necessary, emergency mitigation steps to
resolve immediate security risks associated with the event are taken.

Microsoft also completes an internal post-mortem for data breaches. As a part of this
exercise, sufficiency of response and operating procedures are evaluated, and any
updates that may be necessary to the Security Incident Response Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) or related processes are identified and implemented. Internal
postmortems for data breaches are highly confidential records not available to
customers. Postmortems may, however, be summarized and included in other customer
event notifications. These reports are provided to external auditors for review as part of
Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform routine audit cycles.

Customer notification
Microsoft notifies impacted customers and regulatory authorities of data breaches as
required. Microsoft relies on heavy internal compartmentalization in the operation of



Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform. As a benefit of this design, most
incidents can be scoped to specific customers. The goal is to provide impacted
customers with an accurate, actionable, and timely notice when their data is breached.

After the declaration of a CRSPI, the notification process takes place as expeditiously as
possible while still considering the security risks of moving quickly. Customer notices are
delivered without undue delay, and in any event in no more than 72 hours from the time
we declared a breach except in some limited circumstances, some examples are as
follows:

Microsoft believes that the act of performing a notification increases the risk to
other customers. For example, the act of notifying may tip off an adversary and
cause an inability to remediate.
The 72-hour timeline may leave some incident details unavailable. These details
are provided to customers and regulatory authorities as the investigation
proceeds.

Microsoft provides impacted customers with detailed information enabling them to
perform internal investigations and assisting them in meeting end-user commitments,
while not unduly delaying the notification process. Notification of a data breach for
Azure will be delivered to a customer’s Microsoft Azure service health notifications blade
as a Security Advisory. If warranted, one or more of the following roles may be notified
via email of a security or privacy incident in conjunction with, or in lieu of, a service
health notification:

Azure Subscription Administrators or Owners
Microsoft Entra Global Tenant Administrators
Microsoft Entra tenant Technical Contacts

The Microsoft Azure or Azure Government team may also elect to notify other Microsoft
personnel such as members of Microsoft's Customer Support Service (CSS) team and
the customer's Account Managers (AM) or Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM).
These individuals often have close relationships with the customer and can facilitate
faster remediation.

Notification of a data breach for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is
delivered to the Microsoft 365 admin center under Message Center and has the Data
Privacy tag applied. For more information, see the Message Center FAQ. The global
admin role receives data privacy messages for an organization. Additionally, consider
assigning the Message Center Privacy reader role to other users in your organization
who should see data privacy messages. Other admin roles with access to Message
Center can't view data privacy messages.



Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform
built-in security features
Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform take advantage of the cloud service
infrastructure and built-in security features to keep data safe using security measures
and mechanisms to protect data. In addition, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform provide
efficient data access and collaboration with data integrity and privacy in the following
areas: secure identity, data protection, role based security, and threat management .

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform offerings follow the same Technical
and Organizational measures one or more Microsoft Azure service teams take for
securing against data breach processes. Therefore, any information documented in the
'Microsoft Azure Data Breach' notification document here applies to Microsoft Dynamics
365 and Power Platform as well.

Microsoft Support and Professional
Services and Breach Notification Under
the GDPR
Article • 12/01/2024

Microsoft Professional Services includes a diverse group of technical architects,
engineers, consultants, and support professionals who are dedicated to delivering on
the Microsoft mission of empowering customers to do more and achieve more. Our
Professional Services team includes more than 21,000+ total consultants, Digital
Advisors, engineers, and sales professionals working across 191 countries/regions,
supporting 46 different languages, managing several million engagements per month.
The team engages in customer and partner interactions through on-premise, phone,
web, community, and automated tools. The organization brings broad expertise across
the Microsoft portfolio, leveraging an extensive network of partners, technical
communities, tools, diagnostics, and channels that connect us with our enterprise
customers.

The drive for Microsoft Professional Services' global data protection incident response
team is to (a) employ rigorous operations and processes to prevent data protection
incidents from occurring, (b) manage them professionally and efficiently when they do
occur, and (c) learn from these data protection incidents through regular post-mortem
and program improvements. Microsoft's Professional Services data protection incident
response team's processes and results are reviewed and attested to by multiple security
and compliance audits (for example, ISO/IEC 27001).

Data Protection incident response overview
Microsoft Professional Services is committed to protecting its customers and takes
considerable measures to prevent data protection incidents from occurring as a means
of maintaining customer trust. A data protection incident in the Professional Services
organization is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction,
loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data, or Professional
Services Data, while processed by Microsoft. For Commercial customers that have
purchased Unified Support or Industry Solutions Delivery (ISD), you should refer to your
data protection incident response language in the Microsoft Products and Services Data
Protection Addendum (DPA) .



Scope & limits of data protection incident
response process
Our personal data breach notification process begins when we declare that a personal
data breach has occurred.

To be declared, the Microsoft data protection incident response team must determine
that a data protection incident as defined previously has occurred. Declaration will occur
as soon as all pertinent information is available to determine that a data protection
incident has occurred.

Due to the nature of professional services, some events that seem like Microsoft data
protection incidents aren't necessarily classified as such, because they occurred through
customer's actions or on customer's systems. Microsoft Professional Services doesn't
monitor for, or respond to, data protection incidents within the customer's realm of
responsibility. However, when Microsoft becomes aware of a customer-driven data
protection incident, we classify this incident as a customer-driven data protection
incident, which the data protection incident response team calls an 'event,' inform the
customer of our observation, and as requested, assist them on their response effort, to
the extent required by their interaction with Microsoft. Some examples of customer-
driven data protection incidents include inadvertently sending Microsoft the customer's
passwords and other sensitive data, requests to delete data and being the victim of
fraud.

Some actions are out of scope for this process completely, including general questions
about our data protection policies or standards, data subject right requests, opt-out
requests, product wish lists, or bug reports not related to data protection, data
protection incidents not involving customer's data, and fraud against Microsoft.

Types of data protection incidents
The data protection incident response team has identified a set of scenarios that may
occur in professional services. While adhering to the basic data protection incident
response framework, procedures have been developed and customized to expedite the
response process. For instance, a misdirected email may require little investigation. On
the other hand, identifying malicious personnel may require a complete forensic
investigation due to the surreptitious nature of an offender's activities. This set of
scenarios may provide insight into the data protection incident response process for
professional services.



Data protection incident response process
When Microsoft Professional Services identifies a data protection incident, a triage
process occurs pursuant to which Microsoft (a) assesses the event, (b) determines
whether it's in-scope for this process, (c) determines whether it was malicious, (d)
performs a preliminary investigation and assigns a severity level, and (e) alerts and
coordinates with appropriate stakeholders within Microsoft. The team also begins
recording details for tracking purposes and the post-mortem exercise.

Detection
Microsoft Professional Services continuously monitors the ecosystem for emerging data
protection incidents across all data stores containing personal data—both online and
offline. We use different methods to detect data protection incidents, including
automated alerts, customer reports, reports from external parties, observation of
anomalies, and indications of malicious or hacker activity.

The detection processes used by Microsoft Professional Services are designed to
discover data protection incidents and trigger investigations. For example:

Security vulnerabilities are reported to the Microsoft-wide reporting system for
referral or reported directly to the Professional Services data protection incident
response team.
Customers submit reports via the Customer Support Portal  that describe
suspicious activity.
Professional Services personnel submit escalations. Microsoft employees are
trained to identify and escalate potential security issues.
For tools and systems used in the process of providing Professional Services, the
operations teams use automated system alerts via internal monitoring and alerting
frameworks. These alerts could come in the way of signature-based alarms such as
anti-malware, intrusion detection or via algorithms designed to profile expected
activity and alert upon anomalies.

Data protection incident response drills, testing of data
protection incident response plan
In addition to ongoing training, each year Professional Services executes drills in
partnership with appropriate internal departments to communicate the data protection
incident escalation procedures, roles, and responsibilities to all stabilization team
members. This training prepares key stakeholders for real-world data protection
incidents—whether security, physical, or privacy-driven in nature. This training includes



exercises with representatives of the data protection incident response team, security
team, legal teams, and communications team.

After the exercises, we document the outcome and remediation methods we have
decided to use.

Data protection incident response training
A key component of data protection incident response is personnel training to identify
and report data protection incidents. Personnel in the Professional Services organization
are required to take training that covers privacy fundamentals, GDPR regulations, and
other regulations and best practices on how to identify and report data protection
incidents.

Regular online training is available, and completion is mandatory for all personnel. The
training program employs testing, ongoing surveys, awareness, and follow-up designed
to ensure that training is being understood and retained.

Process
When Microsoft Professional Services organization identifies a data protection incident,
it follows a documented industry standard response plan, beginning with determination
that the data protection incident criteria are met. Where a data protection incident
occurs, it's generally declared immediately after Triage but, depending on complexity,
the declaration may happen at any point when a level of necessary information is
available, including after the investigation stage. On the other hand, the team has
discretion to declare a data protection incident based only on reasonable suspicion of
occurrence. The team may also alternate between the various stages as the investigation
progresses.

Based on the severity level, Microsoft may also complete an internal post-mortem for
data protection incidents. As a part of this exercise, sufficiency of response and
operating procedures are evaluated, and any updates that may be necessary to the Data
Protection Incident Response Standard Operating Procedure or related processes are
identified and implemented. Internal postmortems for data breaches are highly
confidential records not available to customers. Postmortems may, however, be
summarized and included in customer event notifications. As part of a routine audit
cycle, post-mortem processes are reviewed by external auditors to ensure follow-up
occurs.

Notification



When Microsoft Professional Services declares a data protection incident, we target
notification to our customers within 72 hours.

After the declaration of a data protection incident, the notification process takes place
as expeditiously as possible while still considering the security risks of moving quickly.
To ensure that notification can be successfully delivered, it's the customer's
responsibility to ensure that the administrative contact information on each applicable
account, subscription, and online services portal is correct. While the goal is to provide
impacted customers with an accurate, actionable, and timely notice, to achieve the 72-
hour notification commitment the initial notification may not include complete details as
all details may not be available during the early stages of a data protection incident. In
addition, Microsoft may need to withhold some details due to the circumstances of the
data protection incident. For instance, it may be necessary to withhold details if the act
of providing notification increases risk to other customers or interferes with Microsoft's
or law enforcement's ability to catch a malicious actor.

In its capacity as a data processor, Microsoft recognizes that customers are responsible
for determining whether notification is appropriate and, if so, notifying the competent
Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the customer's own data subjects of any personal
data breach. Microsoft Professional Services will work to provide customers with the
information needed to proceed with notice in these circumstances.

When providing notice to customers of a personal data breach, Microsoft will include
the following information, if applicable and known:

Nature of the breach
Mitigation measures Microsoft is taking or proposing
Product, service, application involved
Length of time personal data was exposed, if known
Volume of affected/exposed personal data records, if known
Sub-processor/supplier details, if one is involved in the breach

Office 365 Breach Notification Under the
GDPR
Article • 05/28/2025

As a data processor, Office 365 ensures that our customers are able to meet the GDPR's breach
notification requirements as data controllers. To that end, we're committed to the following
actions:

Provide customers with an ability to specify a dedicated privacy contact who is notified if
a breach occurs. Customers can specify this contact using the Privacy reader role settings
for Message Center.
Notify customers of a personal data breach within 72 hours of a breach being declared.
Notifications are published to the Message Center, which is accessible through the
Microsoft 365 admin center. Secondarily, email notifications are sent to specified contacts
indicating a new Message Center post.
Include in the initial notification, a description of the nature of the breach, approximation
of user impact, and any applicable mitigation steps. If our investigation isn't complete at
the time of initial notification, we'll indicate next steps and timelines for subsequent
communication in our initial notification

Microsoft recognizes that data controllers are responsible for conducting risk assessments and
determining whether a breach requires notification of the customer's DPA. Our notification to
customers provides the information needed to make that assessment. Microsoft therefore
notifies customers of any personal data breach, except for those cases where personal data is
confirmed to be unintelligible (for example, encrypted data where integrity of the keys is
confirmed).

Office 365 investments in data security
In addition to our commitment to provide timely notification of breach, Office 365 strongly
invests in systems, processes, and personnel to reduce the likelihood of personal data breach
and to quickly detect and mitigate consequence of breach if it does occur.

Here's a description of some of our investments in this space:

Access Control Systems. Office 365 maintains a "zero-standing access" policy. This means
that engineers don't have access to the service unless it's explicitly granted in response to
a specific incident that requires elevation of access. Whenever access is granted it's done
under the principle of least privilege: permission granted for a specific request only allows
for a minimal set of actions required to service that request. To do this, Office 365
maintains strict separation between "elevation roles", with each role only allowing certain



predefined actions to be taken. The "Access to Customer Data" role is distinct from other
roles that are more commonly used to administer the service and is scrutinized most
heavily before approval. Together, these investments in access control greatly reduce the
likelihood that an engineer in Office 365 inappropriately accesses customer data.

Security Monitoring Systems and Automation: Office 365 maintains robust, real-time
security monitoring systems. Among other issues, these systems raise alerts for attempts
to illicitly access customer data, or for attempts to illicitly transfer data out of our service.
Related to the points about access control mentioned previously, our security monitoring
systems maintain detailed records of elevation requests that are made, and the actions
taken for a given elevation request. Office 365 also maintains automatic resolution
investments that automatically act to mitigate threats in response to issues we detect,
and dedicated teams for responding to alerts that can't be resolved automatically. To
validate our security monitoring systems, Office 365 regularly conducts red-team
exercises in which an internal penetration testing team simulates attacker behavior
against the live environment. These exercises lead to regular improvements to our
security monitoring and response capabilities.

Personnel and Processes: In addition to the automation described previously, Office 365
maintains processes and teams responsible for both educating the broader organization
about privacy and incident management processes, and for executing those processes
during a breach. For example, a detailed privacy breach Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is maintained and shared with teams throughout the organization. This SOP
describes in detail the roles and responsibilities both of individual teams within Office 365
and centralized security incident response teams. These responsibilities span both what
teams need to do to improve their own security posture (conduct security reviews,
integrate with central security monitoring systems, and other best practices), and what
teams would need to do if an actual breach (rapid escalation to incident response,
maintain and provide specific data sources that will be used to expedite the response
process). Teams are also regularly trained on data classification, and correct handling and
storage procedures for personal data.

The major takeaway is that Office 365 strongly invests in reducing the likelihood and
consequences of personal data breach impacting our customers. If personal data breach does
occur, we're committed to rapidly notifying our customers once that breach is confirmed.

What to expect in the event of breach
The previous section describes the investments Office 365 takes to reduce the likelihood of
data breach. In the unlikely event that breach does occur, customers should expect a
predictable experience in terms of the following responses:



Consistent incident response lifecycle within Office 365. As described above, Office 365
maintains detailed incident response SOPs describing how teams should prepare for
breach and how they should operate if a breach does occur. This ensures that our
protections and processes apply throughout the service.

Consistent criteria for notifying customers. Our notification criteria focus on
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of customer data. Office 365 will directly notify
customers if either the confidentiality or integrity of customer data is impacted. That is,
we'll notify customers if their data is accessed without proper authorization, or if there's
inappropriate destruction or loss of data. Office 365 will also report issues impacting data
availability, although this action is usually done through the Service Health Dashboard
(SHD).

Consistent notification details. When Office 365 does communicate regarding data
breach, customers can expect specific details to be communicated: at minimum, we'll
provide the following details:

Timing of the breach and timing of breach awareness
The approximate number of users impacted
The type of user data that was breached
Actions needed to mitigate the breach, either by the controller or by the processor

Customers should also note that Office 365, as a data processor, doesn't determine the risk of
data breach. Whenever personal data breach is detected, we'll notify our customers and
provide them with the details they need to accurately determine risk to impacted users and to
decide whether further reporting to regulatory authorities is required. To that end, data
controllers are expected to determine the following about the incident:

Breach severity (that is, risk determination)
Whether end users need to be notified
Whether regulators (DPAs) need to be notified
Specific steps to be taken by the controller to mitigate the consequences of breach

Contacting Microsoft
In some scenarios, a customer could become aware of a breach and might wish to notify
Microsoft. The current protocol is for customers to notify Microsoft Support, which will then
interface with engineering teams for more information. In this scenario, Microsoft engineering
teams are similarly committed to providing the information customers need, through their
support contact, in a timely fashion.

Call to action for customers



As noted previously, Microsoft 365 is committed to notifying customers within 72 hours of
breach declaration. The customer's tenant administrator will be notified. Additionally, Microsoft
365 recommends that customers designate one or more individuals as Message Center Privacy
readers, which can be done in the Microsoft 365 admin center. In the event of personal data
breach, resources assigned the Message Center Privacy reader role are able to access the
Message center to see relevant privacy notifications and, depending on their Message center
preferences, might receive a related email.

Windows breach notification under the
GDPR
Article • 12/01/2024

Microsoft takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
seriously. Microsoft takes extensive security measures within its online services to
protect against data breaches. These measures include both physical and logical security
controls, as well as automated security processes, comprehensive information security
and privacy policies, and security and privacy training for all personnel.

Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration
The Windows diagnostic data processor configuration takes advantage of the cloud
service infrastructure and built-in security features to keep data safe using security
measures and mechanisms to protect data.

It follows the same Technical and Organizational measures one or more Microsoft Azure
service teams take for securing against data breach processes. Therefore, any
information documented in the Microsoft Azure Data Breach notification document is
analogous to the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration as well.

Data Protection Impact Assessment for
the GDPR
Article • 12/01/2024

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations
that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and
analyze data for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located.
Additional details can be found in the GDPR Summary article. This document guides you
to information regarding Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) under the GDPR
when using Microsoft products and services.

Terminology
Helpful definitions for GDPR terms used in this document:

Data Controller (Controller): A legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data.
Personal data and data subject: Any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who
can be identified, directly or indirectly.
Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Customer Data: Data produced and stored in the day-to-day operations of running
your business.

What is a DPIA?
The GDPR requires controllers to prepare a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
for operations that are 'likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons.' There's nothing inherent in Microsoft products and services that need
the creation of a DPIA. However, because Microsoft products and services are highly
customizable, a DPIA may be needed depending on the details of your Microsoft
configuration. Microsoft has no control over, and little or no insight into such
information. You, as a data controller must determine appropriate uses of their data.

DPIA in Action



The DPIA guidance applies to Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Support
and Professional Services. That guidance includes consideration of:

When is a DPIA needed?

The risk factors listed below should be addressed when considering whether to
complete a DPIA. Other potential factors and further details are found in Part 1 of each
of the guidelines.

A systematic and extensive evaluation of data based on automated processing.
Processing on a large scale of special categories of data (data revealing
information uniquely identifying a natural person), or of personal data relating to
criminal convictions and offenses.
Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.

The GDPR clarifies 'The processing of personal data shouldn't be considered to be on a
large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an
individual physician, other health care professional, or lawyer. In such cases, a data
protection impact assessment shouldn't be mandatory.'

What is required to complete a DPIA?

A DPIA should provide specific information about the intended processing, which is
detailed in Part 2 of the guidance. That information includes:

Assessment of the necessity, and proportionality of data processing in relation to
the purpose of the DPIA.
Assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
Intended measures to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures,
and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and demonstrate
compliance with the GDPR.
Purposes of processing
Categories of personal data processed
Data retention
Location and transfers of personal data
Data sharing with third-party subprocessors
Data sharing with independent third-parties
Data subject rights

Additional Considerations

Data Protection Impact Assessments:
Guidance for Data Controllers Using
Microsoft Azure
Article • 01/02/2025

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are required to
prepare a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are
"likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons." There's
nothing inherent in Microsoft Azure itself that would necessarily require the creation of
a DPIA by a data controller using it. Rather, whether a DPIA is required will be
dependent on the details and context of how the data controller deploys, configures,
and uses Microsoft Azure. In any case, a DPIA should begin early in the life of a project
and run in parallel to the planning and development process.

The purpose of this document is to provide data controllers with information about
Microsoft Azure that will help them to determine whether a DPIA is needed and, if so,
what details to include.

７ Note

Microsoft is not providing any legal advice in this article. This article is being
provided for informational purposes only. Customers are encouraged to work with
their privacy officers (and/or Data Protection Officer (DPO) where designated)
and/or legal counsel and/or advisors to determine the necessity and content of any
DPIAs related to their use of Microsoft Azure or any other Microsoft online service.

Part 1: Determining whether a DPIA is needed
Article 35 of the GDPR requires a data controller to create a Data Protection Impact
Assessment (DPIA) "[w]here a type of processing in particular using new technologies,
and taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, is
likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons." It further
sets out particular factors that would indicate such a high risk, which is discussed in the
following table: To determine whether a DPIA is needed, a data controller should
consider these factors, along with any other relevant factors, in light of the controller's
specific implementation(s) and use(s) of Microsoft Azure.

Data Protection Impact Assessments:
Guidance for Data Controllers Using
Microsoft Professional Services
Article • 12/01/2024

Introduction to Microsoft Professional Services
Microsoft Professional Services includes a diverse group of technical architects,
engineers, consultants, and support professionals dedicated to delivering on Microsoft's
mission of empowering customers to do more and achieve more. Find out more about
Microsoft Professional Services by visiting the Microsoft Professional Services Trust
page .

Microsoft Professional Services takes its obligations under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) seriously. The information in this document is designed to provide
information about how Microsoft's support and consulting offerings that customers can
use when preparing Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) under GDPR.

Introduction to DPIAs
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are required to
prepare a DPIA for processing operations that are 'likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons.' There's nothing inherent in Microsoft
Professional Services that would necessarily require the creation of a DPIA by a data
controller using it. Rather, whether a DPIA is required depends on the details and
context of the type of services and how the data controller uses the professional
services.

The purpose of this document is to provide data controllers with information about
Professional Services that will help them to determine whether a DPIA is needed and, if
so, what details to include.

Part 1: Determining whether a DPIA is needed
Article 35 of the GDPR requires a data controller to create a Data Protection Impact
Assessment '[w]here a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and
taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, is likely
to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.' It further sets out



particular factors that would indicate such a high risk, which is discussed in the following
table: In determining whether a DPIA is needed, a data controller should consider these
factors, along with any other relevant factors, in light of the data controller's specific
implementation(s) and use(s) of Professional Services.

A systematic and extensive evaluation of Professional Services does perform certain
personal aspects relating to natural persons, routine or automated processing of data, such as

If a data controller used Professional Services to
develop this type of system or used IT systems
to process data collected through such
monitoring, then it would be the responsibility of



Risk Factor Relevant Information about Professional
Services

the data controller as described later in this
table.

７ Note

1 With respect to the criteria that the processing be on a 'large scale,' Recital 91 of
the GDPR clarifies that: 'The processing of personal data should not be considered
to be on a large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or
clients by an individual physician, other health care professional, or lawyer. In such
cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory.'

[Custom Development Note] Professional Services offers a wide variety of consulting
solutions. A data controller could potentially request a solution that, in accordance with
the above criteria, would be a high-risk solution. For instance, a data controller may
request that Professional Services create a solution to develop a business intelligence
engine for employment decisions or credit applications or a solution that involves user
tracking, specialized use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Analytics, or processing of special
categories of personal data.

At the start of an engagement, Professional Services has processes to evaluate and
address high-risk solutions it may be asked to work on. As part of this, Professional
Services may require assurances from the data controller on GDPR compliance (for
example, contractual terms), a plan for development of a DPIA, or other criteria (for
example, agreed operating guidelines) as required of a data processor under the GDPR.
However, regardless of Microsoft's actions it's the responsibility of the data controller to
develop the DPIA with input where applicable from the processor of the customer's
data.

Part 2: Contents of a DPIA
Article 35(7) mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment specifies the purposes
of processing and a systematic description of the envisioned processing. A systematic
description of a comprehensive DPIA might include factors such as the types of data
processed, how long data is retained, where the data is located and transferred, and
what third parties may have access to the data. In addition, the DPIA must include:

an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in
relation to the purposes;



an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; and
the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security
measures, and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to
demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and
legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.

The following table contains information about Professional Services that is relevant to
each of those elements. As in Part 1, data controllers must consider the details provided
in the table, along with any other relevant factors, in the context of the controller's
specific implementation(s) and use(s) of Professional Services.

in its capacity as a data controller and which is outside the
scope of this document.

Data retention Microsoft will retain Support and Consulting Data for the
duration of the customer engagement plus a retention
period after the engagement ends as necessary to ensure
quality and continuity of service. As an example, after a
support case is closed the data is normally retained for a
period to ensure the ability to reference it if the issue re-
emerges and the case is reopened.

When Professional Services provides support, the
engagement length is defined when the support case is
closed. When Professional Services provides consulting
services, the engagement length is often defined by the
work order. In other cases, the engagement length is
defined by the maintenance of the business relationship. In
all cases, Support and Consulting Data will be deleted or
returned on request or in accordance with the customer's
instructions without undue delay using the capabilities
described in the Professional Services Data Subject Rights
Guide .

Location and transfers of personal Due to the nature of Professional Services, including the
data need to provide round-the-clock support, data may be

order.

For personal data from the European Economic Area,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, Microsoft ensures
that transfers of personal data to a third country/region or
an international organization are subject to appropriate
safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR. In
addition to Microsoft's commitments under the Standard
Contractual Clauses for processors and other model
contracts, Microsoft continues to abide by the terms of the
Privacy Shield framework  but will no longer rely on it as a

Data Protection Impact Assessments:
Guidance for Data Controllers Using
Microsoft Office 365
Article • 12/01/2024

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are required to
prepare a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are
'likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.' There's
nothing inherent in Microsoft Office 365 that would necessarily require the creation of a
DPIA by a data controller using it. Rather, whether a DPIA is required will be dependent
on the details and context of how you, as the data controller, deploy, configure, and use
Office 365.

Part 1 of this document provides information about Office 365 to help you, as a data
controller, determine whether a DPIA is needed. If the answer is 'yes,' Parts 2 and 3 of
this document provide key information from Microsoft that can help draft it. Specifically,
Part 2 provides answers applicable to all Office 365 services for each of the required
elements of a DPIA. Part 3 provides additional product-specific information for a
number of the most relevant information needs of our customers for purposes of
drafting their own DPIAs. Part 3 also includes an illustrative DPIA document that you can
download and modify to make drafting DPIAs easier for you.

Office 365 applications and services, include, but are not limited to, Exchange Online,
SharePoint, OneDrive for work and school, Viva Engage, and Microsoft Teams. A more
complete list of services available through Office 365 can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 of
the Office 365 Data Subject Request Guide.

Part 1: Determining whether a DPIA is needed
Article 35 of the GDPR requires a data controller to create a Data Protection Impact
Assessment 'where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking
into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, is likely to
result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.' It further sets out
particular factors that would indicate such a high risk, which are discussed in the
following table. In determining whether a DPIA is needed, you, as a data controller
should consider these factors, along with any other relevant factors, in light of the
controller's specific implementation(s) and use(s) of Office 365.

Risk Factors Relevant Information About Office 365

Purpose(s) of processing The purpose(s) of processing data using Office 365 is
determined by the controller that implements, configures, and
uses it.

As specified by the Product Terms  and Microsoft Products
and Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA) , Microsoft, as
a data processor, processes Customer Data to provide
Customer the Online Services in accordance with Customer's
documented instructions.

As detailed in the standard Product Terms  and Microsoft
Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA) ,
Microsoft also uses Personal Data to support a limited set of



Risk Factors Relevant Information About Office 365

legitimate business operations consisting of: (1) billing and
account management; (2) compensation (for example,
calculating employee commissions and partner incentives); (3)
internal reporting and modeling (for example, forecasting,
revenue, capacity planning, product strategy); (4) financial
reporting and compliance with legal obligations (subject to the
limitations on disclosure of Customer Data outlined in the
Product Terms and Data Protection Addendum).

Microsoft accepts the obligation of a controller of the
processing of personal data to support these specific legitimate
business operations. Microsoft aggregates Personal Data
before using it for our legitimate business operations,
removing Microsoft's ability to identify specific individuals, and
uses personal data in the least identifiable form that will
support processing necessary for legitimate business
operations.

Microsoft will not use Customer Data or information derived
from it for profiling or for advertising or similar commercial
purposes.

Categories of personal data Customer Data: This is all data, including text, sound, video, or
processed image files and software, that customers provide to Microsoft

or that is provided on customers' behalf through their use of
Microsoft online services. It includes data that customers
upload for storage or processing, as well as customizations.
Examples of Customer Data processed in Office 365 include
email content in Exchange Online, and documents or files
stored in SharePoint or OneDrive for work and school.

Service-generated Data: This is data that is generated or
derived by Microsoft through operation of the service, such as
use or performance data. Most of these data contain
pseudonymous identifiers generated by Microsoft.

Diagnostic Data: This data is collected or obtained by
Microsoft from software that is locally installed by Customer in
connection with the Online Service and may also be referred to
as telemetry. This data is commonly identified by attributes of
the locally installed software or the machine that runs that
software.

Support Data: This is data provided to Microsoft by or on
behalf of Customer (or that Customer authorizes Microsoft to
obtain from an Online Service) through an engagement with
Microsoft to obtain technical support for Online Services.



Risk Factors Relevant Information About Office 365

Customer Data, System-generated Log Data, and Support Data
do not include administrator and billing data, such as customer
administrator contact information, subscription information,
and payment data, which Microsoft collects and processes in its
capacity as a data controller and which is outside the scope of
this document.

Data retention Customer Data: As set out in the Data Protection Terms in the
Product Terms and Data Protection Addendum, Microsoft
retains Customer Data for the duration of the customer's right
to use the service and until all Customer Data is deleted or
returned in accordance with the customer's instructions or the
terms of the Product Terms and Data Protection Addendum.

At all times during the term of the customer's subscription, the
customer has the ability to access, extract, and delete Customer
Data stored in the service, subject in some cases to specific
product functionality intended to mitigate the risk of
inadvertent deletion (for example, Exchange recovered items
folder), as further described in product documentation.

Except for free trials and LinkedIn services, Microsoft will retain
Customer Data stored in the Online Service in a limited
function account for 90 days after expiration or termination of
the customer's subscription so that the customer may extract
the data. After the 90-day retention period ends, Microsoft will
disable the customer's account and delete the Customer Data.

Service-generated Data: This data is retained for a default
period of up to 180 days from collection, subject to longer
retention periods where required for security of the services or
to meet legal or regulatory obligations.

For further information about service capability that enables
the customer to delete personal data maintained in the service
at any time, see the Office 365 Data Subject Requests Guide.

Location and transfers of As described in Attachment 1 of the Product Terms, if Customer
personal data provisions its instance of Office 365 in Australia, Canada, the

European Union, France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United
Kingdom, or the United States, Microsoft stores the following
Customer Data at rest only within that location: (1) Exchange
Online mailbox content (e-mail body, calendar entries, and the
content of e-mail attachments), (2) SharePoint site content and
the files stored within that site, (3) files uploaded to OneDrive
for work and school, and (4) project content uploaded to
Project Online.

For personal data transferred out of the European Economic
Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, Microsoft will
ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country/region
or an international organization are subject to appropriate
safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR. In addition
to Microsoft's commitments under the Standard Contractual
Clauses for processors and other model contracts, Microsoft
abides by the terms of the Data Privacy Framework .

Data sharing with third-party Microsoft shares data with third parties acting as our
subprocessors subprocessors to support functions such as customer and

technical support, service maintenance, and other operations.
Any subcontractors to which Microsoft transfers Customer
Data, Support Data, or Personal Data will have entered into
written agreements with Microsoft that are no less protective
than the Data Protection Terms of the Product Terms . All
third-party subprocessors with which Customer Data from
Microsoft's Core Online Services is shared are included in the
Online Services Subprocessor disclosure . All third-party
subprocessors that may access Support Data (including
Customer Data that customers choose to share during their
support interactions) are included in the Microsoft Commercial
Support Contractors list .

Data sharing with independent Some Office 365 products include extensibility options that
third-parties enable, at the controller's election, sharing of data with

independent third parties. For example, Exchange Online is an
extensible platform that allows third-party add-ins or
connectors to integrate with Outlook and extend Outlook's
feature sets. These third-party providers of add-ins or
connectors act independently of Microsoft, and their add-ins or
connectors must be enabled by the users or enterprise
administrators, who authenticate with their add-in or connector
account.

Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data or Support Data to
law enforcement unless required by law. If law enforcement
contacts Microsoft with a demand for Customer Data or
Support Data, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law
enforcement agency to request that data directly from
Customer. If compelled to disclose Customer Data or Support
Data to law enforcement, Microsoft will promptly notify
Customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally
prohibited from doing so.

Upon receipt of any other third-party request for Customer
Data or Support Data, Microsoft will promptly notify Customer
unless prohibited by law. Microsoft will reject the request



Risk Factors Relevant Information About Office 365

unless required by law to comply. If the request is valid,
Microsoft will attempt to redirect the third party to request the
data directly from the customer.

Data subject rights When operating as a processor, Microsoft makes available to
customers (data controllers) the personal data of its data
subjects and the ability to fulfill data subject requests when
they exercise their rights under the GDPR. We do so in a
manner consistent with the functionality of the product and our
role as a processor. If we receive a request from the customer's
data subjects to exercise one or more of its rights under the
GDPR, we redirect the data subject to make its request directly
to the data controller. The Office 365 Data Subject Requests
Guide provides a description to the data controller on how to
support data subject rights using the capabilities in Office 365.

Requests from a data subject to exercise rights under the GDPR
for personal data processed to support the legitimate business
processes should be directed to Microsoft, as clarified in the

Data Protection Impact Assessments:
Guidance for Controllers Using
Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration
Article • 12/01/2024

７ Note

This topic applies to Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro and Education editions, version
1809 with July 2021 update and newer.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), controllers are required to
prepare a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are
'likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.' There's
nothing inherent in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration itself that
would necessarily require the creation of a DPIA by a controller using it. Rather, whether
a DPIA is required depends on the details and context of how the controller deploys,
configures, and uses the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration.

The purpose of this document is to provide controllers with information about the
Windows diagnostic data processor configuration that will help them to determine
whether a DPIA is needed and, if so, what details to include.

７ Note

Microsoft is not providing any legal advice in this document. This document is
being provided for informational purposes only. Customers are encouraged to
work with their privacy officers and legal counsel to determine the necessity and
content of any DPIAs related to their use of the Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration or any other Microsoft online service.

Part 1: Determining whether a DPIA is needed
Article 35 of the GDPR requires a controller to create a Data Protection Impact
Assessment (DPIA) '[w]here a type of processing in particular using new technologies,
and taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, is



likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons'. It further sets
out particular factors that would indicate such a high risk, which is discussed in the
following table. To determine whether a DPIA is needed, a controller should consider
these factors, along with any other relevant factors, in light of the controller's specific
implementation(s) and use(s) of the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration.

incumbent upon the data controller to determine
appropriate uses of the data controller's data.

Part 2: Contents of a DPIA
Article 35(7) mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment specifies the purposes
of processing and a systematic description of the envisioned processing. A systematic
description of a comprehensive DPIA might include factors such as the types of data
processed, how long data is retained, where the data is located and transferred, and
what third parties may have access to the data. In addition, the DPIA must include:

an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in
relation to the purposes;
an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; and
the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security
measures, and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to
demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and
legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.

The following table contains information about the Windows diagnostic data processor
configuration that is relevant to each of those elements. As in Part 1, data controllers
must consider the details provided in the table, along with any other relevant factors, in
the context of the controller' specific implementation(s) and use(s) of the Windows
diagnostic data processor configuration.

configuration is determined by the controller that implements,
configures, and uses it.

Microsoft, as a data processor, processes Windows diagnostic
data according to the terms in Microsoft Product Terms.

As detailed in the Microsoft Product Terms  and Microsoft
Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA) ,
Microsoft also uses Personal Data to support a limited set of
business operations.

Microsoft is the controller of the processing of Windows
diagnostic data for these specific business operations.
Generally, Microsoft aggregates Windows diagnostic data
before using it for our legitimate business operations,
removing Microsoft's ability to identify specific individuals,
and uses Windows diagnostic data in the least identifiable
form that will support processing necessary for legitimate
business operations.

Microsoft won't use Windows diagnostic data collected when
the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration is
enabled, or information derived from it for any advertising or
similar commercial purposes.

Categories of personal data Windows diagnostic data—Technical data from Windows
processed devices about the device and how Windows and related

software are performing. It's used to keep Windows up to
date, secure, reliable, performant, and to make product
improvements. Some examples of Windows diagnostic data
are the type of hardware being used, applications installed
with their respective usage, and reliability information on
device drivers. Some Windows components and apps connect
to Microsoft services directly, but the data they exchange isn't
Windows diagnostic data. For example, exchanging a user’s
location for local weather or news isn't an example of
Windows diagnostic data.
