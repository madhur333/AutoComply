​Supplemental European Privacy Statement​

​The information provided in this Supplemental European Privacy Statement applies only to individuals in​
​the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (collectively, “Europe”). If you are based​
​in Europe, this Supplemental European Privacy Statement applies to you in addition to the Privacy Policy​
​above.​
​References to “personal information” in this Privacy Policy should be understood to include references to​
​“personal data” as defined by the “GDPR” (i.e., the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU​
​GDPR”) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of UK law (“UK GDPR”)). Under the GDPR, personal data is​
​information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be​
​identified.  It does not include ‘anonymous data’ (i.e., information where the identity of the relevant​
​individual has been permanently removed and that individual is no longer identified or identifiable).​

​Rubrik, Inc. is the controller in respect of the personal data covered by this Privacy Policy for the​
​purposes of the GDPR. See ‘European Contacts’ for our contact details.​

​Cookies. With respect to web cookies and other technologies that are not strictly necessary for our​
​provision of the Online Services, Rubrik seeks consent from users of the Online Services in Europe based​
​on a separate​​ Cookies Policy​​.​

​Legal Basis of Processing.​

​●​ ​In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal data, the GDPR requires us to​
​ensure that we have a “legal basis” for that use. Our legal bases for processing your personal​
​information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.  Where we need to perform a​
​contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (“Contractual Necessity”).​

​●​ ​Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do​
​not override those interests (“Legitimate Interests”). More detail about the specific legitimate​
​interests pursued in respect of each Purpose we use your personal information for is set out in​
​the table below.​

​●​ ​Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“Compliance with Law”).​

​●​ ​Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question​
​(“Consent”).  ​

​We have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes​
​for which we use your personal information – for more information on these Purposes and the data​
​types involved, see ‘How we use your personal information’.​

​Personal Data Transfers outside of Europe. ​​Rubrik​​transmits some of your personal data to countries​
​where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your​
​jurisdiction. All transfers of your personal data from Europe to a country that has not been deemed to​
​provide an adequate level of protection will be based upon an adequacy decision or governed by​
​appropriate safeguards in accordance with the GDPR (e.g., the European Commission’s Standard​
​Contractual Clauses or the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement).  Any onward transfer is subject​
​to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.​

​Data Retention.​​ Rubrik keeps personal data as long​​as required to provide our Online Services to you and​
​comply with applicable laws. For example, if you register for an account on the Online Services, we retain​
​your personal data for as long as you have an account with us and then for only as long as required for us​
​to comply with applicable laws, discharge our contractual obligations to you, or defend our legal​
​interests in connection with any claim or defense we could face before any formal dispute resolution​
​body. We take reasonable measures to ensure that personal data is deleted, erased or anonymized as​
​soon as possible once the purposes for which personal data was collected have been fulfilled.​

​If you are located in Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal​
​data that we hold:​

​access to your personal data.​

​you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have​
​exercised your right to object to processing (see below). ​

​●​ ​Transfer​​. Transfer a machine-readable copy of your​​personal data to you or a third party of your​
​choice.​

​●​ ​Restrict​​. Restrict the processing of your personal​​data, for example if you want us to establish its​
​accuracy or the reason for processing it.​

​●​ ​Object​​. Object to our processing of your personal​​data where we are relying on Legitimate​
​Interests – you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for​
​direct marketing purposes.​

​to withdraw that consent at any time.  ​
